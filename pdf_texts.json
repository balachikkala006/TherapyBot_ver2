Lemberger-Truelove\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8916-9678\n\nChapter 2 Abstract\nIn this chapter, the Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory for school counseling \nis explicated.  The need for a theory specific to school counseling is discussed, especially \nconsidering the distinct features of school setting and the particular roles and responsibilities of a \nschool counselor.  The ASE approach suggests that students\u2019 experiences are co-determined by \ntheir internal capacities and their various ecological influences, therefore any intervention must \nbe respondent to each as co-determinants of experience, personal development, and systemic \nchange.   The \u201c5 Cs of ASE theory\u201d are introduced, including curiosity, connectedness, co-\nregulation, compassion, and contribution.  \n\nVarious creatures transmit messages across generations, each intending to prepare the \nsubsequent generation and contribute to their survival and thriving.  Although providing \nguidance and support is not entirely unique to humans, there appear to be no other species that \nerect enduring buildings of education or scrutinize teaching and learning with similar intention, \nformality, and duration.  The sundry activities in K-12 schools are impressive, as they stretch \nacross histories, disciplines, and cultures that are webbed together into complex systems.\nThe systems of webs that exist in the school are further tethered to other webs, with \nstudents, educators, and other stakeholders coming together as a fulcrum that binds the various \nexternal cultural systems to each of the personal and social systems that exist in schools.  Each \nperson entering a school carries arrays of prior influences that collide with those held by \nnumerous other groups and persons, culminating in a genuine latticework of perspectives and \ngovernors of experience.  These webs of experience affect the curricular content and the \ninterpersonal relationships between students and students, students and educators, and students \nand other social forces extending beyond the school walls. \nThese systems of webs are incredibly complex to navigate for young students, educators, \nand other school stakeholders.  Even if the complex social forces were consistently apparent and \naccessible to the players in the school, one could be easily overwhelmed by the sheer \ncomplicatedness of a school.  Unfortunately, the constituent ingredients across all the personal \nand social systems affecting schools are not readily perceptible, nonetheless fairly distributed.  \nInstead, baked into these systems are differing agendas, abilities, and histories or trajectories that \namplify the complexity and inequalities of opportunities.   \nManeuvering the various systems in schools can be challenging and yet critical for \nschooling success, broadly defined.  In this manner, school counselors can be essential allies for \n\nstudents, educators, and stakeholders.  A school counselor supports the total school environment \nand all the participants therein through defining standards of practice, delivering direct and \nindirect student services, managing programs, and assessing the efficacy of school processes and \noutcomes (ASCA, 2019).  The school counselor reflects a proxy agent in a school as described \nby Bandura (1986; 1989); that is, when the capacity of one or more individuals in a school is \nsubjacent to others, the proxy can provide the support that is more compatible with the various \nsystems active in the school.  \nAmplifying the capacity of compromised students, educators, or stakeholders is generally \nlaudable, and yet it can inadvertently contribute to unintended complicity in inimical schooling \nenvironments.  Education, by nature, oscillates between importing messages from various social \ninstitutions and breaking free to new vistas of understanding and functioning.  The promise of \neducation suggests that it is insufficient to simply reproduce cultural artifacts and histories into \nperpetuity (Baudrillard, 1983).  Education should incite humanistic innovation and variation that \nserves the broadest conception of society (Dewey, 1916).  Here the potential of the school \ncounselor is again pertinent, as a school counselor moves alongside the various systems in \nschools while stoking the individual student or educator to forge new meanings, accomplish new \nends, and innovate new permutations within the affecting systems.  \nUnfortunately, the profession of school counseling shoulders a precarious history as \ninfluenced by allied mental health professions, educational structures, and even features internal \nto the profession itself (Borders & Drury, 1992; Levy & Lemberger-Truelove, 2021).  School \ncounseling services are often under-utilized and generally misunderstood across school settings, \nwhich in turn relegates many professionals to administrative roles (Burnham & Jackson, 2000; \n\nDollarhide, Smith, & Lemberger, 2007).  It is also likely that many well-intentioned school \ncounselors have not operated in ways that best support students or their communities.  \nFormal theoretical approaches to practice are intended to combat against such role \nambiguity and resource waste.  At best, theory should reflect the systems that manifest them; \ntheories consider said systems, offer parsimonious and effectual descriptions of the past, or make \npredictions for the future.  For school counseling in particular, any appropriate formal theory \nshould be germane to the systems of education and the development of people across the lifespan \nand yet also embrace these histories enough to encourage new permutations into the future.  \nInspired by innovations across multiple academic and practice disciplines, the \nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) (Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, \n2014; Lemberger-Truelove & Bowers, 2019) theory was explicitly designed for school \ncounselors to work with students, educators, and other school-related persons so that individual \ncapacities ripen into co-regulated experiences and outcomes.  ASE operates from the assumption \nthat all players in the school are indivisible, with varying degrees of influence on the total \nschooling system.  Development of the individual person or school system occurs in reciprocal \nways, with differing magnitudes of input and influence based on the constitution of the system \nand the nature of the school counseling intervention.   \nFrom an ASE perspective, intervention can occur at the individual level or at the systems \nlevel. However, a fully actualized version of the approach suggests that the corresponding \nintervention holds the greatest promise for ongoing and relevant development.  The primary \nfocus remains on the given student\u2019s experience; yet understood that each unique student is \nbound up in their own multiplicity of influences drawn from the surrounding school and other \nsocial systems.  An ASE practitioner asserts that any individual or systemic vicissitude, even the \n\nmost seemingly diminutive or distant, can reverberate throughout the system in profound or \nsubtle ways.   \nASE is a radical perspective on education, suggesting that the end aspiration is a type of \nproto-liberation that paradoxically remains tied to the activating systems.  In principle, ASE is a \nsocial justice approach to education in that the school counselor must always petition the social \nforces that affect students, educators, and their families.  At all times, the development of a \nparticular student, educator, or stakeholder coheres in step with the dynamic changes in the \nschool and social ecologies.  However, ASE is a distinct type of social justice practice, inspired \nby Freire (1970; 1973), in that it retains an appreciation of the humanistic spirit; that is, the \nindividual, when rightly positioned, can rail against oppressive circumstances.  The student is \nsimultaneously a manifest of the system and yet not fully identical to that system; as such, \neducation and any related school counseling intervention can capitalize on the capacity of the \nstudent or other school agent to transcend prior states and conditions, in turn affecting self and \nenvironment as interacting determinants.  \nPertinence of School Counseling Theories\nThe American School Counseling Association (ASCA, n.d.) suggests that school \ncounselors are trained to utilize \u201ctheories and evidence-based techniques that are effective in a \nschool setting, including but not limited to rational emotive behavior therapy, reality therapy, \ncognitive-behavioral therapy, Adlerian, solution-focused brief counseling, person-centered \ncounseling and family systems\u201d (p. 1). While laudable in intent, it is curious given that less than \n.01% of the recent counseling literature reflects interventions delivered by school counselors, \nnonetheless the questionable nature of the empirical designs and limited findings tied to theory or \ndiscernable practice behaviors (Griffith et al., 2019).  To be fair, generic findings from the \n\nliterature suggest that when school counselors perform direct services, the benefits abound for \nstudents and school systems alike (Whiston et al., 2011).  While there are intuitive reasons to \nbelieve in the potential of school counselors and some nascent empirical evidence to support \nsuch claims, the pertinence of theory in these specific contexts remains dubious.  \nEach of the theories mentioned by ASCA (n.d.) are imported from community or clinical \ntherapeutic contexts.  Often psychological theories focus on the functioning and remediation of \nthe single individual.  While ASCA does provide space for emergent approaches, one must \nquestion the utility of any theory not necessarily explicitly intended for the K12 school context, \nnonetheless the specific roles and responsibilities of the professional who will embody that \napproach.  In the case of school counseling, a theory must be able to inform practice in ways that \nare germane to students in classrooms; whole school communities; adult stakeholders as \ninteractants with children in schools; academic, learning, personal, social, and career domains; \nand other factors that directly and indirectly affect the educational experience and beyond.  \nWhile psychological and other theoretical approaches certainly can be helpful guides for \nschool counselors, it is unlikely that these theories can be throughgoing schemes for practice.  As \nan alternative crafted specifically for the qualities implicit in school counseling, ASE offers \npractitioners and recipients a potentially more precise framework to inform practice, evaluate the \nintervention, and assess outcomes specific to K12 school systems. \nBasic Position of ASE\nThe name Advocating Student-within-Environment, or ASE, was coined to highlight the \nprimacy of advocacy.  School counselors are affiliate to each person in a school and the \nencompassing school environment.  Advocacy is the social justice imperative for all school \ncounselors.  Advocacy, as a noun, is a state of supporting a person or cause, especially when it \n\nhas been compromised.  Advocating is a gerund.  As a verb for ASE theory, advocating suggests \nthe perpetual and developmental nature of advocacy.  \nToo often, advocacy is performed with superficial intentions or activities (Lemberger & \nLemberger-Truelove, 2016).  From an ASE perspective, advocating for students requires \nconstant scrutiny of one\u2019s intentions and the means to advocate for student or systems wellness.  \nFor example, one must penetrate the causes and consequences related to how a school \nadministrator reprimands a tardy student.  What circumstances, personal characteristics, cultural \ninfluences, or training influenced the administrators word choice and behaviors?  How does the \nresponse affect the child as a learner in the immediate or long term, or how does the response to \none child affect the total composition of the class of students and their perceptions of class \ncustoms and mores?  Advocacy is a deep and reflective commitment to sustainable positive \ndevelopment.  \nSystems must be challenged to create and sustain conditions that contribute to flourishing \nwhile embracing the inevitability of change and challenge.  For example, scholars suggest that \nschool counselors utilize ASE theory to confront the social determinants of mental health \n(SDMH) that compromise students or adults in schools (Johnson et al., in press).  SDMH \nincludes economic circumstances, physical environment, neighborhood cohesiveness, and \nhealthy food options that influence people\u2019s mental functioning and outcomes.  Improving the \nSDHM for students requires the school counselor to work directly with the student to capitalize \non resources and confront challenges while advocating for more just student and community \nopportunities at the systems levels.  These advocacy behaviors do not suggest that the school \ncounselor pursue a fixed outcome, arbitrated by one person or even ethos; instead, there is a \n\nperennial community process of learning, questioning, and acting to dynamic systems in people \nand total school climates.  \nThe epistemological claim of student-within-environment follows the prime objective of \ncreating more just, equitable, and contributory school environments. This manner of phrasing \nhighlights the embeddedness of each student in a school and other societal contexts.  The student \nas a learner.  The student as a classmate.  The student as an expression of cultural influences.  \nStudent as an athlete, artist, and myriad other identities.  The identities and activities commingle \ntogether and affect the contemporary experience and future aspirations.  This stance highlights \nthe reflexivity between the positionality of the student and the larger encompassing school \nenvironment; the hyphenated word within reminds the school counselor that any intervention \nmust approach the student and school as mutual influencers.  \nThere is a misperception that humans are compos mentis, that is, having complete control \nover one\u2019s mind and agency.  Our intuitions suggest we are making contemporaneous decisions.  \nBut it is impossible to discern if we are making volitional decisions or merely observing the \noutcome of responses to a dense latticework of prior conditions of experience.  Certainly, each \nperson always contributes personally and socially, but the inevitable situatedness of the self in \nthe environment suggests that learning, decision-making, and action are composite to prior \nbiological, psychological, narrative, and social causes.  Even the student in kindergarten, who \nappears to run from tire swing impulsively and indiscriminately to jungle gym and then skipping \nover to peers is influenced by a line of inconceivable prior forces that led to that moment, guided \nthose behaviors, and resulted in one\u2019s felt experience.  As a 5-year-old (or 95-year-old), and \nevery day before and after, we are at least in part an embodiment of various governing systems.  \n\nBut the student is not completely emptied of the capacity to influence oneself or one\u2019s \ncircumstance.  The kindergartener, the prepubescent middle schooler, and the senior approaching \ngraduation are each active agents that can have some determining influence on one\u2019s plight, even \nif one is always tied up in their guiding systems.  In the source writings related to ASE theory \n(Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014), the concepts of contributory and detracting \ngovernors were introduced to describe social forces that cooccur with the student in schools.  In \nthe contemporary literature, one-half of the governing equation has adopted a related term, social \ndeterminants of mental health (Allen et al., 2014), an offshoot of an earlier term, the social \ndeterminants of health.  Whereas the SDMH are an attempt to define and describe antecedent \ninfluences of psychological functioning, the term governor is retained in ASE theory to depict \nthe collaborative nature of the student-within-environment.  Additionally, governors highlight \nthe non-normative and sophisticated manner in that prior influences can be helpful or harmful \nand evolve in function and influence over time; \u201ccontributory governors (assets) within the \nschool environment, identify and conceptualize detracting governors (impediments), and \nintervene in concert toward the student generated desired outcome\u201d (Lemberger & Hutchison, \n2014, p. 32).\nThis distinction is important in a school counseling context, as school counseling must \nretain the essence of professional counseling, which is different from the other allied helping \nprofessions that tend to be concerned with a psychological self or fully socially consequential \nbeing.  Professional counselors are distinguished by our identity, which is chiefly concerned with \nprevention, development, wellness, and social justice (Myers, 1992).  School counselors are not \npositioned to remedy personal maladies, but rather our focus is chiefly on creating opportunities \nfor the student to thrive in personally and socially germane ways over long durations of time.  \n\nConsidering the types of counseling behaviors typical of school counselors, that is direct \ninstruction in classrooms (typically psychoeducational in nature), small groups of students in and \noutside of classrooms, individual counseling sessions, and consultation with teachers, it is \nreasonable that theory must cohere with the idea that counseling is additive as an interacting \ndeterminant in the student and school system.  Stated more simply, school counseling is not \nsimply inspiring insights; counseling binds to experience to govern new possibilities and \nlikelihoods.   \nThe highest aspiration of ASE can be found in the concept of sapience, \u201cor wisdom as \nexpressed through critical consciousness is an outcome status inbuilt with the cognitive, \naffective, and behavioral complexity for the student to anticipate and respond to oppressive \nenvironments, even after such environments evolve\u201d (Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014, p. 37).  In \ndevelopmentally different ways dependent on the schooling level and cultural conditions for the \nstudent, sapience, as conceptually consistent with critical consciousness (Freire, 1973), is \nrequired so that the student has the agency to transcend or liberate from the oppressive or \nlimiting social structures. \nASE poses an epistemological challenge to approaches primarily concerned with the \nstudent as a largely autonomous self or the student as a passive recipient of school and societal \ninfluences.  But more than a conceptual framework, ASE informs school counseling praxis in \nspecific ways.  The basic assumption is that formal schooling structures are intended to activate \nand support students\u2019 inner capacities and aid their development. They might have more \nopportunities throughout life in and beyond the school environment.  Therefore, school \ncounselors aim to cultivate students' capacities while succoring people, phenomena, and qualities \n\nin the school environment so that student capacities might flourish.  As stated otherwise, ASE is \nabout creating personal and social conditions for opportunity.\n  Rather than focusing on circumstantial events or specific personal expressions, from an \nASE perspective, the primary focus of intervention is on capacities that are generalizable to \nmyriad outcomes.  For example, cultivating students\u2019 executive functioning, which is the \nantecedent to goal-focused action, is relevant to learning, achievement, social skills, and multiple \nother life experiences (Jacob & Parkinson, 2015).  As such, the practice focus for ASE \ndifferentiates itself from related approaches given the centrality of interactional causality in \nintervening with students-within-environments. \nThe theory of development implicit to ASE theory is patently consistent with the design \nof education, therefore, a unique fit for counseling services rendered in school environments. \nLike the assumptions of Bayesian analyses, the likelihood of something occurring in the future is \npredicated on the prior knowledge of a probabilistic event (Ghosh et al., 2007).  Education draws \nfrom various cultural artifacts or information, whether from the natural or social sciences, to \nperpetuate advances into the future.  In this manner, ASE suggests that school counseling \nincludes the various processes to sharpen the capacities of the individual (e.g., a particular \nstudent, one or more educators, family members, or relevant community members) while \nsimultaneously curating the most hospitable social conditions, and then linking these prior \nconditions for the student and dynamics in the school environment. \nWhether academic content, social experiences, or career aspirations, school counselors \nmust collaborate with students such that historical influences can culminate into more desirable \nand intentional ends. As a theory, ASE is concerned with the confluence of causal influencers \nand experiential governors. It is like a kaleidoscope where the capacities of the individual student \n\nare likened to one or a series of colors and filtered through the colors that represent the various \naspects of the school environment. The interaction between the self and the environment reflects \nboth originating colors in the kaleidoscope, but as the various colored crystals come together, \nthey are a bit different. As a practice of counseling, the school counselor is like the fingers that \ngrasp the kaleidoscope and work with the student to expose the various colored opportunities, \nespecially as attractive to the student\u2019s perspective.  \nASE school counseling focuses on student (and school system) outcomes but is not \nnecessarily a primary driver in discerning how to support. Rather, the concern taps down on how \nthe school counselor can engender capacities in the student that are iterative and flexible while \nalso cultivating school conditions that propel continuous reflection and growth. As Vygotsky \n(1978) wisely offered: \nThe search for a method becomes one of the most important problems of the entire \nenterprise of understanding the uniquely human forms of psychological activity. In this \ncase, the method is simultaneously prerequisite and product, the tool and the result of the \nstudy. (p.65)\nFor school counseling, this suggests that the practice is the outcome, as is the inverse. A school \ncounselor provides the student and environment with the prior conditions to experience the \ndesired outcomes and helps induce that experience to be general and flexible.   \nOrientation and Practice Foci for ASE School Counseling\nAt its core, ASE is a theory to support learning. School counselors support student \nlearning, including academic learning, personal or social learning, or even learning pertaining to \ncareer development (ASCA, 2019). School counselors also support adults and other community \npartners in learning how to interface with students as learners or as relational beings. Learning \n\nincludes various profoundly complex personal and social processes (Darling-Hammond et al., \n2020). School counselors can collaborate with students and representatives of the school \nenvironment to augment and amplify mutually beneficial learning that crosses learning, social, \nand vocational domains.  \nASE theory contains specific orientations and practice foci intended to support students \nand aspects of the school environment. Collectively titled the \u201c5 Cs of ASE theory\u201d, these \ninclude curiosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution. As orientations to \nexperience, the five Cs represent the qualities aimed at sapience in students, educators, and even \nthe school counselor. This orientation harkens to the suggestion proffered by Vygotsky that the \nmethod (of being or orientation) is the outcome. As practices, the 5 Cs of ASE provide the \nschool counselor with a framework that can inspire theoretically unique counseling practices or \noverlays to guide general practices in an ASE motif.  \n(insert Figure 2.1 here)\nCuriosity \nThe condition of curiosity is universally familiar to most people and yet a precise and \nshared definition is elusive or varied.  Kidd and Hayden (2015) posited that curiosity is a \u201cdrive \nstate for information\u201d (p. 450). William James famously suggested that curiosity \n\u201cis perhaps a rather poor term by which to designate the impulse toward better \ncognition in its full extent\u2026 In its higher, more intellectual form, the impulse toward \ncompleter knowledge takes the character of scientific or philosophic curiosity. \u2026 Young \nchildren are possessed by curiosity about every new impression that assails them.\u201d \n(James, 1899, p. 45 \u2013 46). \n\nThere is a teleological dimension to curiosity, wherefrom the curious seeker strives towards \nsome conceptual or experiential resolve or end. Curiosity can also be sustainable through \npersistent inquiry and openness (Abdelghani et al., 2022). But curiosity also suggests emergence \nfrom a nescience state of being. To be curious is paradoxical in that one has some impression \nabout a target and maintains an open and incomplete inquisitiveness about that target or its \nrelated aspects.  \nFrom an ASE perspective, curiosity is central as a personal quality and a counseling \nprocess.  As a personal quality, school counselors who embody curiosity are more likely to \nestablish a helpful rapport with the student or educator, and by extension, such rapport \ncontributes to desirable counseling outcomes (Elliot et al., 2018). For student or educator \nrecipients of counseling, a curious state operates as the receptivity to personal and social \nexploration in counseling and the grounds for ongoing development. As the school environment \nlevel, curiosity is the humility necessary to apprehend the uniqueness of the particular student or \neducator.  Considered together, curiosity as a state in schools includes qualities such as openness, \nreflexivity, tenacity, humility, inquisitiveness, flexibility, emotional dexterity, and many other \nattributes necessary in affiliating prior states with emergent states of being.  \nThere are certainly developmental differences in how children and adults experience and \nexpress curiosity (Beiser, 1984). From an ASE perspective, one is not required to believe or even \ncomprehend another person\u2019s state of curiosity but one is required to believe that that person \nexperiences it. Therefrom, the process of curiosity emerges from the various states of curiosity.  \nA school counselor is meta-curious or curious about the curiosity of others. These efforts can \namplify and validate the curiosity of the student or educator while also initiating the rapport \nnecessary for effective counseling in a school environment.  \n\nJust as there are developmental differences in the experience and expression of curiosity, \nthere can be cultural differences (Dyche & Zayas, 1995). While it is not necessarily the student\u2019s \nor educator\u2019s responsibility to satisfy the cultural curiosities of the school counselor, processes \nsuch as cultural broaching (see Day-Vines et al., 2021) can be a valuable way to learn how one is \nvarious identity structures affects experience in and outside of counseling. \nInvoking curiosity in a school counseling session can be accomplished in various ways, \nnot limited to the nature of the in-session activity or even the expression of curious language. \nActivities that encourage curiosity include prompts to challenge students to consider what \ninfluences decision-making processes. Additionally, minimally curious language might be \nsomething such as, \u201cWhat did you accomplish?\u201d whereas \u201cHow did you experience your \naccomplishments?\u201d or \u201cWhat contributed to your feelings of accomplishment?\u201d In both \nexamples, you can receive specific information about the accomplishment, but only in the latter \ntwo does the prompt encourage elaboration beyond an isolated or normative outcome. \nFrom an ASE perspective, curiosity is a necessary state and process that must be \naccomplished at the student and school environment levels. For curiosity to be personally \nrelevant and environmentally sustainable, a persistent commitment to curiosity must be tended. \nCuriosity is a brilliant yet challenging orientation to experience; the great dream psychologist \nCarl Jung (1964) once offered a helpful prescription for curiosity when he described how he \nanalyzes dreams: \nIt is for this reason that I have always said to my pupils: \u201cLearn as much as you can about \nsymbolism; then forget it all when you are analyzing a dream.\u201d This advice is of such \npractical importance that I have made it a rule to remind myself that I can never \nunderstand somebody else\u2019s dream well enough to interpret it correctly. I have done this \n\nin order to check the flow of my own associations and reactions, which might otherwise \nprevail over my patient\u2019s uncertainties and hesitations. (p. 42)\nThere is a novelty in each moment and each opportunity for development.  This brand of \ncuriosity is its own process and outcome for the ASE-inspired school counselor.  \nConnectedness \nTo be curious about something or someone, there must be some affiliation to that thing or \nperson; the conceptual location for that curiosity is the experience of connectedness. From an \nASE perspective, connectedness is the experience of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and \nrespect shared between students, school counselors, educators, or other school-related persons \n(Osterman, 2000; Resnick et al., 1997). Given the systems nature of ASE, the concept of \nconnectedness demonstrates the interrelatedness of experience with all school participants. \nCertainly, each person has a unique first-person perspective. That idiosyncrasy colors the \nkaleidoscopic experience in novel and emergent ways, yet the connections between people as the \nprior determinants of experience are ubiquitous.  \nConnectedness as a state of being can assist the school counselor in making tentative \nassessments about the student or school environment. Copacetic connections generally reflect a \ncoherence between the student and the prompting environment. For academic content, \nconnections represent the possible coherence of the content. Socially, when one is generally \nbonded to a certain peer group or cause.  Alternatively, when one experiences disconnection, one \ncan experience threats, uncertainty, and disengagement.  \nJust as ruptured or threatened connections can be problematic, overly entangled \nconnections can potentially limit functioning. Returning to the kaleidoscope metaphor, if the \nstudent must conform to a certain way of being (i.e., a certain color in the prism), this potentially \n\nforecloses the profound diversity of experience feasible within each person, across time and \npotential experiences with others.  This type of enmeshment is the antithesis of education, as it is \na delimiting governor that stifles the student or the school environment.  \nA school counselor who utilizes connectedness in their work will toil to find and \naccentuate relatedness between the student and school environment. There is a delicate balance \nin connectedness practices, as one does not want to inadvertently promote coercion or \nconformity. This is especially important given the authority of one\u2019s role as a school counselor. \nSimilarly, one must account for one\u2019s cultural capital in connectedness praxis, for the goal of \nASE work is student sapience and critical consciousness, not merely assimilating into the school \nenvironment (which has assimilated from larger socio-cultural systems). Instead, connectedness \nis adopting an orientation that is both aware of one\u2019s thrownness into a system and maintaining \nthe wherewithal not to be fully consumed by that system.  \n For the particular student, connectedness in counseling should be validating and \nchallenging. We validate that the lived experience is phenomenologically coherent and, yet, \nsimply because that experience is valid, it does not preclude that there are other experiences or \nconnections. In this way, connectedness is related to concepts such as empathy and yet is \nconceptually different. Like empathy, through connection, we bridge perspectives, and yet, it is \ndifferent from empathy in that there is not the baggage of a single first-person experience.  \nThis is an important distinction, especially for working with children and adolescents. For \nexample, because connectedness talk does not essentialize the person or experience, the school \ncounselor can differentiate a behavior from an absolute person or way of being. For example, a \nstudent can misunderstand a concept and retain the capacity to understand other concepts or later \ngrasp the misconceived concept.  \n\nCo-regulation\nIn ASE theory, co-regulation is the fulcrum between the student and the school \nenvironment. McCaslin (2009) defined co-regulation as the interface of two or more self-\naware, intentional individuals who draw from various cultural, social, and personal sources to \ninform and influence behavior. Experientially, the student cannot be reduced to self but rather \nan agent with various systems. How one regulates one\u2019s experiences and aspirations in those \nsystems requires one to co-regulate. Imagine a rock being thrown into a river. The rock is \npredisposed by its gravity and form to pursue the riverbed, yet the current alters that tragedy \nbased on the magnitude of the current. Students are certainly goal-directed, yet even the most \nvolitionally able student responds to the learning and social opportunities, including \nopportunities that are either knowable or unknown. \nAs an orientation for experience, a self-regulated individual can monitor, predict, shift, \nand direct one\u2019s internal and external experiences (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994), whereas \noperating out of a co-regulated orientation, one extends beyond one\u2019s inner psychological \nexperiences and places total experience in a broader social and historical context. For the \nschool counselor, a co-regulated perspective can help extend connectedness across peoples \nand contexts. For example, it is clich\u00e9 to dismiss student behavior to tropes such as, \u201cthey are \nthat way because of their parents.\u201d In contrast, a co-regulated perspective understands that \nacross the generations, there are various personal and social causes and consequences. Those \nparents will not spontaneously develop parenting skills simply because they are procreated. \nCo-regulation as an orientation reminds the school counselor that there are myriad \ndeterminants of experience in all the various players in the school system.  \n\nAs an orientation for students and members of the school environment, co-regulation is \nthe emotional, cognitive, and behavioral capacity to respond in a way that is personally and \nsocially relevant. Even at very young ages, children can often discern how certain conditions \naffect their experiences. From an ASE perspective, co-regulation is not necessarily an end in \nitself. Rather, the process of co-regulating one\u2019s orientation within larger systems is a process \nthat stokes a co-regulated end that is more connected and contributory to students and \nmembers of the school environment alike.  \nThis generative way of considering co-regulation can inspire school counseling \napproaches and behaviors. For example, consider the differences between the following two \nstatements with similar intent: \u201cWhat have you done to improve yourself?\u201d is different than \n\u201cHow have you pursued your goals given the influences of (insert circumstance)?\u201d In the \nformer, the school counselor has inadvertently essentialized a single experience or \ninterpretation; moreover, this form of question coerces the student to acknowledge \nimprovement when maybe that does not cohere with the student\u2019s experience. In the case of \nthe latter, with only a few more words, the student is encouraged to consider multiple \npossibilities, as each exists within their influencing context.  \nJust as co-regulation binds together the experiences and pursuit of the student and the \naspects of the school environment, as a concept within ASE theory, it also binds together the \n5Cs. The curiosity required of the student must be co-regulated with curiosities found in the \nschool environment. In the same way, connectedness requires feelings of safety, affiliation, \nand rapport to be co-regulated and distributed. Finally, co-regulation anticipates the final two \nCs, which are primarily expressions of curiosity and connectedness.  \nCompassion\n\nBeing curious, connected, and co-regulated can exhaust the cognitive load on students \nand members of the school community.  Compassion is the orientation and practice of \npersonal and social acceptance with discernment.  This form of acceptance does not suggest \nthat agents in a school affirm and internalize deleterious experiences of social conditions; \ninstead, compassion suggests that to endure the complexity of being a complex self who is \ntethered to various competing systems, discerning prior causes and effects of experience in a \nbenevolent and focused way can protect one\u2019s wellbeing and better position oneself for future \npersonal and social development.   \n\u201cCom-\u201c as a prefix means together or with, as in student-within-environment.  Passion \nis understood as the intense or enthused desire for or state of something.  From an ASE \nperspective, compassion is being with the desire of the student or member of the school \nenvironment.  This is a co-regulated process shared between the school counselor, student, \nand relevant parties in the school.  \nFor the student, a compassionate orientation validates their various experiences as a \nsocial being.  Although adults might romantically reminisce about childhood, each stage of \none\u2019s youth can be littered with challenges of various sorts (Erikson, 1950).  Compassion \nacknowledges the vigor necessary to pass through these stages while affirming that all \npersonal or social pursuits are imprecise, context-specific, and emergent.  The orientation of \ncompassion is illustrated in the counselor statement suggested by Brigman and Webb (2010), \nDon\u2019t doubt your ability, try another strategy. \nCompassion suggests that all expressions are reasonable within context, yet it is \nshortsighted to essentialize any one or more expressions.  A week before writing this chapter, \nmy daughter (Matthew) asked me when she was walking to school, \u201cDaddy, is it okay to be \n\nafraid of things?\u201d  To which I responded, \u201cCertainly.  Fear can be a great gift, even if it seems \ntemporarily inconvenient and scary.  It is your body letting you know that there is a potential \nthreat out there and you should be attentive.  What is not necessarily okay is to be stuck in our \nfear and only experience things in one way, especially long after the threat is mostly gone.\u201d  \nHerein I tried to invoke compassion by validating her genuine experience of fear and yet also \nappreciate that she is complex and her circumstances will evolve over time.  \nA second anecdote to illustrate compassion comes from my experiences as a professor.  \nI once had a colleague who struggled with mental well-being, culminating in misperceptions \nand literal hallucinations.  Unfortunately, his status was so compromised that it impaired his \nwork as a professor, and he stopped all professional activities.  After a while, I was asked by \nrepresentatives in the university about the college and some of the circumstances that afflicted \nhim (e.g., workplace stress, harassment from colleagues).  The perspective I offered was \nsimply this, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe what my colleague believes, but I believe that my \ncolleague believes these things.\u201d  Compassion requires one to acknowledge that almost any \nperspective is experientially true, but there are also many influencing truths and \ninterpretations for any one or more truths. Compassion is being with the passion for the \nperson to experience self-within-environment, while being with the passion required for the \nself to continue to pursue new vistas of self and environment.   \nThe practice of compassion requires that the school counselor embody and express the \nfirst three Cs (curiosity, connectedness, and co-regulation) and couple those with the \nacceptance and discernment of compassion.  This process can be accomplished by utilizing an \nadapted version of Rapoport\u2019s Rules (popularized by philosopher Daniel Dennett [2013]):\nFigure 2\n\nRapoport\u2019s Rules\nASE\n1. You should attempt to re-express your target\u2019s position \nso clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, \n\u201cThanks, I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\n2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if \nthey are not matters of general or widespread \nagreement).\n3. You should mention anything you have learned from \nyour target.\n4.\n5. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word \nof rebuttal or criticism.\nExpand position to multiple \nalternative explanations (influences) \nand/or outcomes. \nCompassion is a high order skill in ASE theory and should be pursued cautiously.  \nCompassion can come off as supercilious. ASE is a social justice and personal liberation \napproach to school counseling; therefore, compassion is not some covert process to pacify the \nstudent or educator or exonerate unjust school environments.  Instead, compassion is the \norientation and practice of discerning the determinants of experience, conceiving of their \nvarious effects, and ascertaining composure such that one can continue to regulate the self and \nenvironment to new and benefiting ends.  \nContribution\nThe first 4 Cs of ASE generally co-occur in the counseling process, yet the final C is \nnecessary to fully actualize ASE.  Contribution is the co-regulated efforts to change social \nsystems and personal commitments to social advocacy.  Contribution operates as a \nproto\u2013Archimedean Point or ultimate ethic for the theory.  Unlike many ethical positions, \ncontribution is more than a concept; instead, it is a living value that must be committed to \nthrough action.  \nGiven the incredible complexity of school and other social systems, logical contribution \nfollows the maturation of the 4 initial Cs.  This said it is conceivable that the mere act of \n\nparticipating in the type of social advocacy to vivify contribution, experiences of curiosity, \nconnectedness, co-regulation, and compassion might manifest.  For example, a school counselor \nmight work with a teacher to elucidate how district disciplinary policies overrepresent certain \npopulations of students.  In pursuing more restorative practices, the school counselor and teacher \nmight have new understandings for students (curiosity), connect with these students\u2019 behaviors \nwithin systems, and co-regulate new classroom climates.  \nContribution reflects Freire\u2019s (1974) belief in mutual liberation of the oppressed and \noppressor; there is a total commitment to solidarity and prosperity at the personal and social \nlevels.  Consistent with the other 4 Cs in ASE theory, contribution is not a simple or always \napparent course.  Oftentimes, contribution must be scrutinized or run the risk of creating new \nhegemonies in the place of prior oppressive forces in the school system.  For example, in efforts \nto create greater access to one group, educators must be attentive to implications for other \noppressed students in the system.  \nIn practice, this recognition requires the humanistic practitioner to amplify the voices and \nagency of the oppressed, rather than simply serving as a proxy on their behalf. Certainly \nthere are occasions when it is reasonable to use the social positionality of the practitioner \nor even oppressor to support the justice needs of the oppressed, but one\u2019s power is not an \nabsolute and it should be allocated as soon as is possible. Social justice advocacy is not \nan end onto itself; rather, a goal of social justice praxis is to amplify the agency of the \noppressed in such a manner that they are better able to self-advocate and confront \ninjustices. (Lemberger & Lemberger-Truelove, 2016, p. 576)\nASE is not a theory that is sans ethical presuppositions.  ASE is a dialogical approach, \noscillating between the interests in the student and the social environment as interacting \n\ndeterminants of experience.  Therefore, any just action in the school must be deemed ethical at \nthe individual and systems level.  This is not to be confused with consensus building, as that \nethical approach tends to tilt in the direction of the most powerful agent or stagnates through \nassimilation within the system.  \nThis ethical stance in a school can be incredibly complex and stifling, yet it is not a \nreason for inaction.  Participants in schools are always contributing.  The dialogical nature of \npursuing personally and socially just behaviors, therefore, suggests that curiosity, connectedness, \nco-regulation, and compassion must repeatedly filter any action on behalf of the student or \nschool environment.  \nThe Counseling Relationship\nPenetrating through the middle of the 5 Cs of ASE theory is its adherence to the common \nfactors of counseling literature (Wampold, 2015).  This literature suggests that a particular theory \nonly accounts for a small amount of client development.  Instead, factors external to the \ncounseling process largely dictate client outcomes; from an ASE perspective, this point endorses \nthe role of the school counselor as social justice advocate.  Within the counseling relationship, \ncommon factors are certain qualities that contribute to desirable outcomes across theoretical \norientations.  \nIn a counterintuitive way, the common factors literature supports the uniqueness of ASE \ntheory.  One of the primary predictors of counselor influenced outcomes pertains to the cultural \nfitness of the intervention.  As such, it is reasonable that the most appropriate approach to \nworking with students, educators, and other stakeholders in schools is through the application of \nan approach tailored to the culture of schools, the developmental and functional needs of \nstudents, and the roles and responsibilities endemic to school counselors.  \n\nMore than a tacit endorsement of ASE, the common factors literature explicitly highlights \nthe importance of rapport as a healing ingredient (Wampold, 2015).  The 5 Cs of ASE are the \nmechanism proscribed to establish mutual respect and to engender hopefulness in the client, \nwhich prove to be vital ingredients in counseling rapport. \nConcluding Thoughts \nSchool counselors operate in complex school systems.  At their disposal includes various \ndelivery systems to help support students and other parties, including classroom guidance and \npsychoeducational activities, small group counseling, individual counseling, coordination and \ncollaboration, and consultation.  Filtered through an ASE framework, each of these counseling \nformats can potentially support students and elements of the school environment as \ninterdependent governors of experience.  \nThe ASE perspective can appear almost paradoxical.  On the one hand, an ASE \npractitioner is required to act with (or within) a student\u2019s perspective.  This suggests a deep \nrespect for the current functioning of the client.  If there are any maladies, those are honored as \ncomponents of one\u2019s experience.  On the other hand, to be with the student as a counselor \nsuggests, one must ameliorate the experiences of the student and the school environment. \nThere is a resolution.  Unlike allied theoretical approaches that suggest a change in \nperspective or encourage the student to renarrative one\u2019s constructed messages, the ASE \napproach is primarily concerned with creating the personal and social conditions as preventative \npositions pointing towards ongoing development.  Stated more simply, school counseling reflects \nthe acme of education, that is pulling from one\u2019s history and compelling the self to be an active \nparticipant in that unfolding history.  As one\u2019s capacities are sharpened in the various counseling \n\nexperiences and as social circumstances in the school are made more equitable and usable, the \nself within systems emerge in more intended and prosperous ends. \nIt still feels like a volitional choice directed by the student.  The causal conditions of \nchoice were established in the student as an indivisible system and the school as another aspect \nof myriad systems.  There is a type of epistemological compatibilism in this resolve in that each \nstudent can affect one\u2019s destiny as it unfolds, but only insofar as those actions were enacted prior \nto their occurrence in the school.  The student\u2019s acumen as a reader and their exposure to \nempowering contexts contributes to one\u2019s moral compass.  How one engages in peer \ncommunication coupled with the peers in one\u2019s social groups affects what notes are or are not \npassed in geometry class. \nThe school counselor stands alongside each student and the total school environment.  \nLike all other governors in the kaleidoscope that is the school environment, the school \ncounselor\u2019s own orientation and practices contribute to future possibilities.  The spirit of ASE \ncan be best summarized in the following two quotes: \n\u201cTo best prepare young children in poverty for later life challenges, professional \ncounselors must make every attempt to improve social conditions; however, it is equally \nimportant that young children\u2019s internal capacities be strengthened either to \naccommodate improved social conditions or to maximize resilience in the face of \npersistent adversity\u201d (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2018, p. 299). \nand \n\u201cstudents from disenfranchised communities do not accept inadequate or deleterious \nsocial conditions; instead, using\u2026 strategies, they accept their cognitive and affective \n\nreactions and respond with clearer intentionality.\u201d (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2018, p. \n299) \n\nReferences\nAbdelghani, R., Oudeyer, P.

Lemberger-Truelove\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8916-9678\n\nChapter 2 Abstract\nIn this chapter, the Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory for school counseling \nis explicated.  The need for a theory specific to school counseling is discussed, especially \nconsidering the distinct features of school setting and the particular roles and responsibilities of a \nschool counselor.  The ASE approach suggests that students\u2019 experiences are co-determined by \ntheir internal capacities and their various ecological influences, therefore any intervention must \nbe respondent to each as co-determinants of experience, personal development, and systemic \nchange.   The \u201c5 Cs of ASE theory\u201d are introduced, including curiosity, connectedness, co-\nregulation, compassion, and contribution.  \n\nVarious creatures transmit messages across generations, each intending to prepare the \nsubsequent generation and contribute to their survival and thriving.  Although providing \nguidance and support is not entirely unique to humans, there appear to be no other species that \nerect enduring buildings of education or scrutinize teaching and learning with similar intention, \nformality, and duration.  The sundry activities in K-12 schools are impressive, as they stretch \nacross histories, disciplines, and cultures that are webbed together into complex systems.\nThe systems of webs that exist in the school are further tethered to other webs, with \nstudents, educators, and other stakeholders coming together as a fulcrum that binds the various \nexternal cultural systems to each of the personal and social systems that exist in schools.  Each \nperson entering a school carries arrays of prior influences that collide with those held by \nnumerous other groups and persons, culminating in a genuine latticework of perspectives and \ngovernors of experience.  These webs of experience affect the curricular content and the \ninterpersonal relationships between students and students, students and educators, and students \nand other social forces extending beyond the school walls. \nThese systems of webs are incredibly complex to navigate for young students, educators, \nand other school stakeholders.  Even if the complex social forces were consistently apparent and \naccessible to the players in the school, one could be easily overwhelmed by the sheer \ncomplicatedness of a school.  Unfortunately, the constituent ingredients across all the personal \nand social systems affecting schools are not readily perceptible, nonetheless fairly distributed.  \nInstead, baked into these systems are differing agendas, abilities, and histories or trajectories that \namplify the complexity and inequalities of opportunities.   \nManeuvering the various systems in schools can be challenging and yet critical for \nschooling success, broadly defined.  In this manner, school counselors can be essential allies for \n\nstudents, educators, and stakeholders.  A school counselor supports the total school environment \nand all the participants therein through defining standards of practice, delivering direct and \nindirect student services, managing programs, and assessing the efficacy of school processes and \noutcomes (ASCA, 2019).  The school counselor reflects a proxy agent in a school as described \nby Bandura (1986; 1989); that is, when the capacity of one or more individuals in a school is \nsubjacent to others, the proxy can provide the support that is more compatible with the various \nsystems active in the school.  \nAmplifying the capacity of compromised students, educators, or stakeholders is generally \nlaudable, and yet it can inadvertently contribute to unintended complicity in inimical schooling \nenvironments.  Education, by nature, oscillates between importing messages from various social \ninstitutions and breaking free to new vistas of understanding and functioning.  The promise of \neducation suggests that it is insufficient to simply reproduce cultural artifacts and histories into \nperpetuity (Baudrillard, 1983).  Education should incite humanistic innovation and variation that \nserves the broadest conception of society (Dewey, 1916).  Here the potential of the school \ncounselor is again pertinent, as a school counselor moves alongside the various systems in \nschools while stoking the individual student or educator to forge new meanings, accomplish new \nends, and innovate new permutations within the affecting systems.  \nUnfortunately, the profession of school counseling shoulders a precarious history as \ninfluenced by allied mental health professions, educational structures, and even features internal \nto the profession itself (Borders & Drury, 1992; Levy & Lemberger-Truelove, 2021).  School \ncounseling services are often under-utilized and generally misunderstood across school settings, \nwhich in turn relegates many professionals to administrative roles (Burnham & Jackson, 2000; \n\nDollarhide, Smith, & Lemberger, 2007).  It is also likely that many well-intentioned school \ncounselors have not operated in ways that best support students or their communities.  \nFormal theoretical approaches to practice are intended to combat against such role \nambiguity and resource waste.  At best, theory should reflect the systems that manifest them; \ntheories consider said systems, offer parsimonious and effectual descriptions of the past, or make \npredictions for the future.  For school counseling in particular, any appropriate formal theory \nshould be germane to the systems of education and the development of people across the lifespan \nand yet also embrace these histories enough to encourage new permutations into the future.  \nInspired by innovations across multiple academic and practice disciplines, the \nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) (Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, \n2014; Lemberger-Truelove & Bowers, 2019) theory was explicitly designed for school \ncounselors to work with students, educators, and other school-related persons so that individual \ncapacities ripen into co-regulated experiences and outcomes.  ASE operates from the assumption \nthat all players in the school are indivisible, with varying degrees of influence on the total \nschooling system.  Development of the individual person or school system occurs in reciprocal \nways, with differing magnitudes of input and influence based on the constitution of the system \nand the nature of the school counseling intervention.   \nFrom an ASE perspective, intervention can occur at the individual level or at the systems \nlevel. However, a fully actualized version of the approach suggests that the corresponding \nintervention holds the greatest promise for ongoing and relevant development.  The primary \nfocus remains on the given student\u2019s experience; yet understood that each unique student is \nbound up in their own multiplicity of influences drawn from the surrounding school and other \nsocial systems.  An ASE practitioner asserts that any individual or systemic vicissitude, even the \n\nmost seemingly diminutive or distant, can reverberate throughout the system in profound or \nsubtle ways.   \nASE is a radical perspective on education, suggesting that the end aspiration is a type of \nproto-liberation that paradoxically remains tied to the activating systems.  In principle, ASE is a \nsocial justice approach to education in that the school counselor must always petition the social \nforces that affect students, educators, and their families.  At all times, the development of a \nparticular student, educator, or stakeholder coheres in step with the dynamic changes in the \nschool and social ecologies.  However, ASE is a distinct type of social justice practice, inspired \nby Freire (1970; 1973), in that it retains an appreciation of the humanistic spirit; that is, the \nindividual, when rightly positioned, can rail against oppressive circumstances.  The student is \nsimultaneously a manifest of the system and yet not fully identical to that system; as such, \neducation and any related school counseling intervention can capitalize on the capacity of the \nstudent or other school agent to transcend prior states and conditions, in turn affecting self and \nenvironment as interacting determinants.  \nPertinence of School Counseling Theories\nThe American School Counseling Association (ASCA, n.d.) suggests that school \ncounselors are trained to utilize \u201ctheories and evidence-based techniques that are effective in a \nschool setting, including but not limited to rational emotive behavior therapy, reality therapy, \ncognitive-behavioral therapy, Adlerian, solution-focused brief counseling, person-centered \ncounseling and family systems\u201d (p. 1). While laudable in intent, it is curious given that less than \n.01% of the recent counseling literature reflects interventions delivered by school counselors, \nnonetheless the questionable nature of the empirical designs and limited findings tied to theory or \ndiscernable practice behaviors (Griffith et al., 2019).  To be fair, generic findings from the \n\nliterature suggest that when school counselors perform direct services, the benefits abound for \nstudents and school systems alike (Whiston et al., 2011).  While there are intuitive reasons to \nbelieve in the potential of school counselors and some nascent empirical evidence to support \nsuch claims, the pertinence of theory in these specific contexts remains dubious.  \nEach of the theories mentioned by ASCA (n.d.) are imported from community or clinical \ntherapeutic contexts.  Often psychological theories focus on the functioning and remediation of \nthe single individual.  While ASCA does provide space for emergent approaches, one must \nquestion the utility of any theory not necessarily explicitly intended for the K12 school context, \nnonetheless the specific roles and responsibilities of the professional who will embody that \napproach.  In the case of school counseling, a theory must be able to inform practice in ways that \nare germane to students in classrooms; whole school communities; adult stakeholders as \ninteractants with children in schools; academic, learning, personal, social, and career domains; \nand other factors that directly and indirectly affect the educational experience and beyond.  \nWhile psychological and other theoretical approaches certainly can be helpful guides for \nschool counselors, it is unlikely that these theories can be throughgoing schemes for practice.  As \nan alternative crafted specifically for the qualities implicit in school counseling, ASE offers \npractitioners and recipients a potentially more precise framework to inform practice, evaluate the \nintervention, and assess outcomes specific to K12 school systems. \nBasic Position of ASE\nThe name Advocating Student-within-Environment, or ASE, was coined to highlight the \nprimacy of advocacy.  School counselors are affiliate to each person in a school and the \nencompassing school environment.  Advocacy is the social justice imperative for all school \ncounselors.  Advocacy, as a noun, is a state of supporting a person or cause, especially when it \n\nhas been compromised.  Advocating is a gerund.  As a verb for ASE theory, advocating suggests \nthe perpetual and developmental nature of advocacy.  \nToo often, advocacy is performed with superficial intentions or activities (Lemberger & \nLemberger-Truelove, 2016).  From an ASE perspective, advocating for students requires \nconstant scrutiny of one\u2019s intentions and the means to advocate for student or systems wellness.  \nFor example, one must penetrate the causes and consequences related to how a school \nadministrator reprimands a tardy student.  What circumstances, personal characteristics, cultural \ninfluences, or training influenced the administrators word choice and behaviors?  How does the \nresponse affect the child as a learner in the immediate or long term, or how does the response to \none child affect the total composition of the class of students and their perceptions of class \ncustoms and mores?  Advocacy is a deep and reflective commitment to sustainable positive \ndevelopment.  \nSystems must be challenged to create and sustain conditions that contribute to flourishing \nwhile embracing the inevitability of change and challenge.  For example, scholars suggest that \nschool counselors utilize ASE theory to confront the social determinants of mental health \n(SDMH) that compromise students or adults in schools (Johnson et al., in press).  SDMH \nincludes economic circumstances, physical environment, neighborhood cohesiveness, and \nhealthy food options that influence people\u2019s mental functioning and outcomes.  Improving the \nSDHM for students requires the school counselor to work directly with the student to capitalize \non resources and confront challenges while advocating for more just student and community \nopportunities at the systems levels.  These advocacy behaviors do not suggest that the school \ncounselor pursue a fixed outcome, arbitrated by one person or even ethos; instead, there is a \n\nperennial community process of learning, questioning, and acting to dynamic systems in people \nand total school climates.  \nThe epistemological claim of student-within-environment follows the prime objective of \ncreating more just, equitable, and contributory school environments. This manner of phrasing \nhighlights the embeddedness of each student in a school and other societal contexts.  The student \nas a learner.  The student as a classmate.  The student as an expression of cultural influences.  \nStudent as an athlete, artist, and myriad other identities.  The identities and activities commingle \ntogether and affect the contemporary experience and future aspirations.  This stance highlights \nthe reflexivity between the positionality of the student and the larger encompassing school \nenvironment; the hyphenated word within reminds the school counselor that any intervention \nmust approach the student and school as mutual influencers.  \nThere is a misperception that humans are compos mentis, that is, having complete control \nover one\u2019s mind and agency.  Our intuitions suggest we are making contemporaneous decisions.  \nBut it is impossible to discern if we are making volitional decisions or merely observing the \noutcome of responses to a dense latticework of prior conditions of experience.  Certainly, each \nperson always contributes personally and socially, but the inevitable situatedness of the self in \nthe environment suggests that learning, decision-making, and action are composite to prior \nbiological, psychological, narrative, and social causes.  Even the student in kindergarten, who \nappears to run from tire swing impulsively and indiscriminately to jungle gym and then skipping \nover to peers is influenced by a line of inconceivable prior forces that led to that moment, guided \nthose behaviors, and resulted in one\u2019s felt experience.  As a 5-year-old (or 95-year-old), and \nevery day before and after, we are at least in part an embodiment of various governing systems.  \n\nBut the student is not completely emptied of the capacity to influence oneself or one\u2019s \ncircumstance.  The kindergartener, the prepubescent middle schooler, and the senior approaching \ngraduation are each active agents that can have some determining influence on one\u2019s plight, even \nif one is always tied up in their guiding systems.  In the source writings related to ASE theory \n(Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014), the concepts of contributory and detracting \ngovernors were introduced to describe social forces that cooccur with the student in schools.  In \nthe contemporary literature, one-half of the governing equation has adopted a related term, social \ndeterminants of mental health (Allen et al., 2014), an offshoot of an earlier term, the social \ndeterminants of health.  Whereas the SDMH are an attempt to define and describe antecedent \ninfluences of psychological functioning, the term governor is retained in ASE theory to depict \nthe collaborative nature of the student-within-environment.  Additionally, governors highlight \nthe non-normative and sophisticated manner in that prior influences can be helpful or harmful \nand evolve in function and influence over time; \u201ccontributory governors (assets) within the \nschool environment, identify and conceptualize detracting governors (impediments), and \nintervene in concert toward the student generated desired outcome\u201d (Lemberger & Hutchison, \n2014, p. 32).\nThis distinction is important in a school counseling context, as school counseling must \nretain the essence of professional counseling, which is different from the other allied helping \nprofessions that tend to be concerned with a psychological self or fully socially consequential \nbeing.  Professional counselors are distinguished by our identity, which is chiefly concerned with \nprevention, development, wellness, and social justice (Myers, 1992).  School counselors are not \npositioned to remedy personal maladies, but rather our focus is chiefly on creating opportunities \nfor the student to thrive in personally and socially germane ways over long durations of time.  \n\nConsidering the types of counseling behaviors typical of school counselors, that is direct \ninstruction in classrooms (typically psychoeducational in nature), small groups of students in and \noutside of classrooms, individual counseling sessions, and consultation with teachers, it is \nreasonable that theory must cohere with the idea that counseling is additive as an interacting \ndeterminant in the student and school system.  Stated more simply, school counseling is not \nsimply inspiring insights; counseling binds to experience to govern new possibilities and \nlikelihoods.   \nThe highest aspiration of ASE can be found in the concept of sapience, \u201cor wisdom as \nexpressed through critical consciousness is an outcome status inbuilt with the cognitive, \naffective, and behavioral complexity for the student to anticipate and respond to oppressive \nenvironments, even after such environments evolve\u201d (Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014, p. 37).  In \ndevelopmentally different ways dependent on the schooling level and cultural conditions for the \nstudent, sapience, as conceptually consistent with critical consciousness (Freire, 1973), is \nrequired so that the student has the agency to transcend or liberate from the oppressive or \nlimiting social structures. \nASE poses an epistemological challenge to approaches primarily concerned with the \nstudent as a largely autonomous self or the student as a passive recipient of school and societal \ninfluences.  But more than a conceptual framework, ASE informs school counseling praxis in \nspecific ways.  The basic assumption is that formal schooling structures are intended to activate \nand support students\u2019 inner capacities and aid their development. They might have more \nopportunities throughout life in and beyond the school environment.  Therefore, school \ncounselors aim to cultivate students' capacities while succoring people, phenomena, and qualities \n\nin the school environment so that student capacities might flourish.  As stated otherwise, ASE is \nabout creating personal and social conditions for opportunity.\n  Rather than focusing on circumstantial events or specific personal expressions, from an \nASE perspective, the primary focus of intervention is on capacities that are generalizable to \nmyriad outcomes.  For example, cultivating students\u2019 executive functioning, which is the \nantecedent to goal-focused action, is relevant to learning, achievement, social skills, and multiple \nother life experiences (Jacob & Parkinson, 2015).  As such, the practice focus for ASE \ndifferentiates itself from related approaches given the centrality of interactional causality in \nintervening with students-within-environments. \nThe theory of development implicit to ASE theory is patently consistent with the design \nof education, therefore, a unique fit for counseling services rendered in school environments. \nLike the assumptions of Bayesian analyses, the likelihood of something occurring in the future is \npredicated on the prior knowledge of a probabilistic event (Ghosh et al., 2007).  Education draws \nfrom various cultural artifacts or information, whether from the natural or social sciences, to \nperpetuate advances into the future.  In this manner, ASE suggests that school counseling \nincludes the various processes to sharpen the capacities of the individual (e.g., a particular \nstudent, one or more educators, family members, or relevant community members) while \nsimultaneously curating the most hospitable social conditions, and then linking these prior \nconditions for the student and dynamics in the school environment. \nWhether academic content, social experiences, or career aspirations, school counselors \nmust collaborate with students such that historical influences can culminate into more desirable \nand intentional ends. As a theory, ASE is concerned with the confluence of causal influencers \nand experiential governors. It is like a kaleidoscope where the capacities of the individual student \n\nare likened to one or a series of colors and filtered through the colors that represent the various \naspects of the school environment. The interaction between the self and the environment reflects \nboth originating colors in the kaleidoscope, but as the various colored crystals come together, \nthey are a bit different. As a practice of counseling, the school counselor is like the fingers that \ngrasp the kaleidoscope and work with the student to expose the various colored opportunities, \nespecially as attractive to the student\u2019s perspective.  \nASE school counseling focuses on student (and school system) outcomes but is not \nnecessarily a primary driver in discerning how to support. Rather, the concern taps down on how \nthe school counselor can engender capacities in the student that are iterative and flexible while \nalso cultivating school conditions that propel continuous reflection and growth. As Vygotsky \n(1978) wisely offered: \nThe search for a method becomes one of the most important problems of the entire \nenterprise of understanding the uniquely human forms of psychological activity. In this \ncase, the method is simultaneously prerequisite and product, the tool and the result of the \nstudy. (p.65)\nFor school counseling, this suggests that the practice is the outcome, as is the inverse. A school \ncounselor provides the student and environment with the prior conditions to experience the \ndesired outcomes and helps induce that experience to be general and flexible.   \nOrientation and Practice Foci for ASE School Counseling\nAt its core, ASE is a theory to support learning. School counselors support student \nlearning, including academic learning, personal or social learning, or even learning pertaining to \ncareer development (ASCA, 2019). School counselors also support adults and other community \npartners in learning how to interface with students as learners or as relational beings. Learning \n\nincludes various profoundly complex personal and social processes (Darling-Hammond et al., \n2020). School counselors can collaborate with students and representatives of the school \nenvironment to augment and amplify mutually beneficial learning that crosses learning, social, \nand vocational domains.  \nASE theory contains specific orientations and practice foci intended to support students \nand aspects of the school environment. Collectively titled the \u201c5 Cs of ASE theory\u201d, these \ninclude curiosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution. As orientations to \nexperience, the five Cs represent the qualities aimed at sapience in students, educators, and even \nthe school counselor. This orientation harkens to the suggestion proffered by Vygotsky that the \nmethod (of being or orientation) is the outcome. As practices, the 5 Cs of ASE provide the \nschool counselor with a framework that can inspire theoretically unique counseling practices or \noverlays to guide general practices in an ASE motif.  \n(insert Figure 2.1 here)\nCuriosity \nThe condition of curiosity is universally familiar to most people and yet a precise and \nshared definition is elusive or varied.  Kidd and Hayden (2015) posited that curiosity is a \u201cdrive \nstate for information\u201d (p. 450). William James famously suggested that curiosity \n\u201cis perhaps a rather poor term by which to designate the impulse toward better \ncognition in its full extent\u2026 In its higher, more intellectual form, the impulse toward \ncompleter knowledge takes the character of scientific or philosophic curiosity. \u2026 Young \nchildren are possessed by curiosity about every new impression that assails them.\u201d \n(James, 1899, p. 45 \u2013 46). \n\nThere is a teleological dimension to curiosity, wherefrom the curious seeker strives towards \nsome conceptual or experiential resolve or end. Curiosity can also be sustainable through \npersistent inquiry and openness (Abdelghani et al., 2022). But curiosity also suggests emergence \nfrom a nescience state of being. To be curious is paradoxical in that one has some impression \nabout a target and maintains an open and incomplete inquisitiveness about that target or its \nrelated aspects.  \nFrom an ASE perspective, curiosity is central as a personal quality and a counseling \nprocess.  As a personal quality, school counselors who embody curiosity are more likely to \nestablish a helpful rapport with the student or educator, and by extension, such rapport \ncontributes to desirable counseling outcomes (Elliot et al., 2018). For student or educator \nrecipients of counseling, a curious state operates as the receptivity to personal and social \nexploration in counseling and the grounds for ongoing development. As the school environment \nlevel, curiosity is the humility necessary to apprehend the uniqueness of the particular student or \neducator.  Considered together, curiosity as a state in schools includes qualities such as openness, \nreflexivity, tenacity, humility, inquisitiveness, flexibility, emotional dexterity, and many other \nattributes necessary in affiliating prior states with emergent states of being.  \nThere are certainly developmental differences in how children and adults experience and \nexpress curiosity (Beiser, 1984). From an ASE perspective, one is not required to believe or even \ncomprehend another person\u2019s state of curiosity but one is required to believe that that person \nexperiences it. Therefrom, the process of curiosity emerges from the various states of curiosity.  \nA school counselor is meta-curious or curious about the curiosity of others. These efforts can \namplify and validate the curiosity of the student or educator while also initiating the rapport \nnecessary for effective counseling in a school environment.  \n\nJust as there are developmental differences in the experience and expression of curiosity, \nthere can be cultural differences (Dyche & Zayas, 1995). While it is not necessarily the student\u2019s \nor educator\u2019s responsibility to satisfy the cultural curiosities of the school counselor, processes \nsuch as cultural broaching (see Day-Vines et al., 2021) can be a valuable way to learn how one is \nvarious identity structures affects experience in and outside of counseling. \nInvoking curiosity in a school counseling session can be accomplished in various ways, \nnot limited to the nature of the in-session activity or even the expression of curious language. \nActivities that encourage curiosity include prompts to challenge students to consider what \ninfluences decision-making processes. Additionally, minimally curious language might be \nsomething such as, \u201cWhat did you accomplish?\u201d whereas \u201cHow did you experience your \naccomplishments?\u201d or \u201cWhat contributed to your feelings of accomplishment?\u201d In both \nexamples, you can receive specific information about the accomplishment, but only in the latter \ntwo does the prompt encourage elaboration beyond an isolated or normative outcome. \nFrom an ASE perspective, curiosity is a necessary state and process that must be \naccomplished at the student and school environment levels. For curiosity to be personally \nrelevant and environmentally sustainable, a persistent commitment to curiosity must be tended. \nCuriosity is a brilliant yet challenging orientation to experience; the great dream psychologist \nCarl Jung (1964) once offered a helpful prescription for curiosity when he described how he \nanalyzes dreams: \nIt is for this reason that I have always said to my pupils: \u201cLearn as much as you can about \nsymbolism; then forget it all when you are analyzing a dream.\u201d This advice is of such \npractical importance that I have made it a rule to remind myself that I can never \nunderstand somebody else\u2019s dream well enough to interpret it correctly. I have done this \n\nin order to check the flow of my own associations and reactions, which might otherwise \nprevail over my patient\u2019s uncertainties and hesitations. (p. 42)\nThere is a novelty in each moment and each opportunity for development.  This brand of \ncuriosity is its own process and outcome for the ASE-inspired school counselor.  \nConnectedness \nTo be curious about something or someone, there must be some affiliation to that thing or \nperson; the conceptual location for that curiosity is the experience of connectedness. From an \nASE perspective, connectedness is the experience of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and \nrespect shared between students, school counselors, educators, or other school-related persons \n(Osterman, 2000; Resnick et al., 1997). Given the systems nature of ASE, the concept of \nconnectedness demonstrates the interrelatedness of experience with all school participants. \nCertainly, each person has a unique first-person perspective. That idiosyncrasy colors the \nkaleidoscopic experience in novel and emergent ways, yet the connections between people as the \nprior determinants of experience are ubiquitous.  \nConnectedness as a state of being can assist the school counselor in making tentative \nassessments about the student or school environment. Copacetic connections generally reflect a \ncoherence between the student and the prompting environment. For academic content, \nconnections represent the possible coherence of the content. Socially, when one is generally \nbonded to a certain peer group or cause.  Alternatively, when one experiences disconnection, one \ncan experience threats, uncertainty, and disengagement.  \nJust as ruptured or threatened connections can be problematic, overly entangled \nconnections can potentially limit functioning. Returning to the kaleidoscope metaphor, if the \nstudent must conform to a certain way of being (i.e., a certain color in the prism), this potentially \n\nforecloses the profound diversity of experience feasible within each person, across time and \npotential experiences with others.  This type of enmeshment is the antithesis of education, as it is \na delimiting governor that stifles the student or the school environment.  \nA school counselor who utilizes connectedness in their work will toil to find and \naccentuate relatedness between the student and school environment. There is a delicate balance \nin connectedness practices, as one does not want to inadvertently promote coercion or \nconformity. This is especially important given the authority of one\u2019s role as a school counselor. \nSimilarly, one must account for one\u2019s cultural capital in connectedness praxis, for the goal of \nASE work is student sapience and critical consciousness, not merely assimilating into the school \nenvironment (which has assimilated from larger socio-cultural systems). Instead, connectedness \nis adopting an orientation that is both aware of one\u2019s thrownness into a system and maintaining \nthe wherewithal not to be fully consumed by that system.  \n For the particular student, connectedness in counseling should be validating and \nchallenging. We validate that the lived experience is phenomenologically coherent and, yet, \nsimply because that experience is valid, it does not preclude that there are other experiences or \nconnections. In this way, connectedness is related to concepts such as empathy and yet is \nconceptually different. Like empathy, through connection, we bridge perspectives, and yet, it is \ndifferent from empathy in that there is not the baggage of a single first-person experience.  \nThis is an important distinction, especially for working with children and adolescents. For \nexample, because connectedness talk does not essentialize the person or experience, the school \ncounselor can differentiate a behavior from an absolute person or way of being. For example, a \nstudent can misunderstand a concept and retain the capacity to understand other concepts or later \ngrasp the misconceived concept.  \n\nCo-regulation\nIn ASE theory, co-regulation is the fulcrum between the student and the school \nenvironment. McCaslin (2009) defined co-regulation as the interface of two or more self-\naware, intentional individuals who draw from various cultural, social, and personal sources to \ninform and influence behavior. Experientially, the student cannot be reduced to self but rather \nan agent with various systems. How one regulates one\u2019s experiences and aspirations in those \nsystems requires one to co-regulate. Imagine a rock being thrown into a river. The rock is \npredisposed by its gravity and form to pursue the riverbed, yet the current alters that tragedy \nbased on the magnitude of the current. Students are certainly goal-directed, yet even the most \nvolitionally able student responds to the learning and social opportunities, including \nopportunities that are either knowable or unknown. \nAs an orientation for experience, a self-regulated individual can monitor, predict, shift, \nand direct one\u2019s internal and external experiences (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994), whereas \noperating out of a co-regulated orientation, one extends beyond one\u2019s inner psychological \nexperiences and places total experience in a broader social and historical context. For the \nschool counselor, a co-regulated perspective can help extend connectedness across peoples \nand contexts. For example, it is clich\u00e9 to dismiss student behavior to tropes such as, \u201cthey are \nthat way because of their parents.\u201d In contrast, a co-regulated perspective understands that \nacross the generations, there are various personal and social causes and consequences. Those \nparents will not spontaneously develop parenting skills simply because they are procreated. \nCo-regulation as an orientation reminds the school counselor that there are myriad \ndeterminants of experience in all the various players in the school system.  \n\nAs an orientation for students and members of the school environment, co-regulation is \nthe emotional, cognitive, and behavioral capacity to respond in a way that is personally and \nsocially relevant. Even at very young ages, children can often discern how certain conditions \naffect their experiences. From an ASE perspective, co-regulation is not necessarily an end in \nitself. Rather, the process of co-regulating one\u2019s orientation within larger systems is a process \nthat stokes a co-regulated end that is more connected and contributory to students and \nmembers of the school environment alike.  \nThis generative way of considering co-regulation can inspire school counseling \napproaches and behaviors. For example, consider the differences between the following two \nstatements with similar intent: \u201cWhat have you done to improve yourself?\u201d is different than \n\u201cHow have you pursued your goals given the influences of (insert circumstance)?\u201d In the \nformer, the school counselor has inadvertently essentialized a single experience or \ninterpretation; moreover, this form of question coerces the student to acknowledge \nimprovement when maybe that does not cohere with the student\u2019s experience. In the case of \nthe latter, with only a few more words, the student is encouraged to consider multiple \npossibilities, as each exists within their influencing context.  \nJust as co-regulation binds together the experiences and pursuit of the student and the \naspects of the school environment, as a concept within ASE theory, it also binds together the \n5Cs. The curiosity required of the student must be co-regulated with curiosities found in the \nschool environment. In the same way, connectedness requires feelings of safety, affiliation, \nand rapport to be co-regulated and distributed. Finally, co-regulation anticipates the final two \nCs, which are primarily expressions of curiosity and connectedness.  \nCompassion\n\nBeing curious, connected, and co-regulated can exhaust the cognitive load on students \nand members of the school community.  Compassion is the orientation and practice of \npersonal and social acceptance with discernment.  This form of acceptance does not suggest \nthat agents in a school affirm and internalize deleterious experiences of social conditions; \ninstead, compassion suggests that to endure the complexity of being a complex self who is \ntethered to various competing systems, discerning prior causes and effects of experience in a \nbenevolent and focused way can protect one\u2019s wellbeing and better position oneself for future \npersonal and social development.   \n\u201cCom-\u201c as a prefix means together or with, as in student-within-environment.  Passion \nis understood as the intense or enthused desire for or state of something.  From an ASE \nperspective, compassion is being with the desire of the student or member of the school \nenvironment.  This is a co-regulated process shared between the school counselor, student, \nand relevant parties in the school.  \nFor the student, a compassionate orientation validates their various experiences as a \nsocial being.  Although adults might romantically reminisce about childhood, each stage of \none\u2019s youth can be littered with challenges of various sorts (Erikson, 1950).  Compassion \nacknowledges the vigor necessary to pass through these stages while affirming that all \npersonal or social pursuits are imprecise, context-specific, and emergent.  The orientation of \ncompassion is illustrated in the counselor statement suggested by Brigman and Webb (2010), \nDon\u2019t doubt your ability, try another strategy. \nCompassion suggests that all expressions are reasonable within context, yet it is \nshortsighted to essentialize any one or more expressions.  A week before writing this chapter, \nmy daughter (Matthew) asked me when she was walking to school, \u201cDaddy, is it okay to be \n\nafraid of things?\u201d  To which I responded, \u201cCertainly.  Fear can be a great gift, even if it seems \ntemporarily inconvenient and scary.  It is your body letting you know that there is a potential \nthreat out there and you should be attentive.  What is not necessarily okay is to be stuck in our \nfear and only experience things in one way, especially long after the threat is mostly gone.\u201d  \nHerein I tried to invoke compassion by validating her genuine experience of fear and yet also \nappreciate that she is complex and her circumstances will evolve over time.  \nA second anecdote to illustrate compassion comes from my experiences as a professor.  \nI once had a colleague who struggled with mental well-being, culminating in misperceptions \nand literal hallucinations.  Unfortunately, his status was so compromised that it impaired his \nwork as a professor, and he stopped all professional activities.  After a while, I was asked by \nrepresentatives in the university about the college and some of the circumstances that afflicted \nhim (e.g., workplace stress, harassment from colleagues).  The perspective I offered was \nsimply this, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe what my colleague believes, but I believe that my \ncolleague believes these things.\u201d  Compassion requires one to acknowledge that almost any \nperspective is experientially true, but there are also many influencing truths and \ninterpretations for any one or more truths. Compassion is being with the passion for the \nperson to experience self-within-environment, while being with the passion required for the \nself to continue to pursue new vistas of self and environment.   \nThe practice of compassion requires that the school counselor embody and express the \nfirst three Cs (curiosity, connectedness, and co-regulation) and couple those with the \nacceptance and discernment of compassion.  This process can be accomplished by utilizing an \nadapted version of Rapoport\u2019s Rules (popularized by philosopher Daniel Dennett [2013]):\nFigure 2\n\nRapoport\u2019s Rules\nASE\n1. You should attempt to re-express your target\u2019s position \nso clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, \n\u201cThanks, I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\n2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if \nthey are not matters of general or widespread \nagreement).\n3. You should mention anything you have learned from \nyour target.\n4.\n5. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word \nof rebuttal or criticism.\nExpand position to multiple \nalternative explanations (influences) \nand/or outcomes. \nCompassion is a high order skill in ASE theory and should be pursued cautiously.  \nCompassion can come off as supercilious. ASE is a social justice and personal liberation \napproach to school counseling; therefore, compassion is not some covert process to pacify the \nstudent or educator or exonerate unjust school environments.  Instead, compassion is the \norientation and practice of discerning the determinants of experience, conceiving of their \nvarious effects, and ascertaining composure such that one can continue to regulate the self and \nenvironment to new and benefiting ends.  \nContribution\nThe first 4 Cs of ASE generally co-occur in the counseling process, yet the final C is \nnecessary to fully actualize ASE.  Contribution is the co-regulated efforts to change social \nsystems and personal commitments to social advocacy.  Contribution operates as a \nproto\u2013Archimedean Point or ultimate ethic for the theory.  Unlike many ethical positions, \ncontribution is more than a concept; instead, it is a living value that must be committed to \nthrough action.  \nGiven the incredible complexity of school and other social systems, logical contribution \nfollows the maturation of the 4 initial Cs.  This said it is conceivable that the mere act of \n\nparticipating in the type of social advocacy to vivify contribution, experiences of curiosity, \nconnectedness, co-regulation, and compassion might manifest.  For example, a school counselor \nmight work with a teacher to elucidate how district disciplinary policies overrepresent certain \npopulations of students.  In pursuing more restorative practices, the school counselor and teacher \nmight have new understandings for students (curiosity), connect with these students\u2019 behaviors \nwithin systems, and co-regulate new classroom climates.  \nContribution reflects Freire\u2019s (1974) belief in mutual liberation of the oppressed and \noppressor; there is a total commitment to solidarity and prosperity at the personal and social \nlevels.  Consistent with the other 4 Cs in ASE theory, contribution is not a simple or always \napparent course.  Oftentimes, contribution must be scrutinized or run the risk of creating new \nhegemonies in the place of prior oppressive forces in the school system.  For example, in efforts \nto create greater access to one group, educators must be attentive to implications for other \noppressed students in the system.  \nIn practice, this recognition requires the humanistic practitioner to amplify the voices and \nagency of the oppressed, rather than simply serving as a proxy on their behalf. Certainly \nthere are occasions when it is reasonable to use the social positionality of the practitioner \nor even oppressor to support the justice needs of the oppressed, but one\u2019s power is not an \nabsolute and it should be allocated as soon as is possible. Social justice advocacy is not \nan end onto itself; rather, a goal of social justice praxis is to amplify the agency of the \noppressed in such a manner that they are better able to self-advocate and confront \ninjustices. (Lemberger & Lemberger-Truelove, 2016, p. 576)\nASE is not a theory that is sans ethical presuppositions.  ASE is a dialogical approach, \noscillating between the interests in the student and the social environment as interacting \n\ndeterminants of experience.  Therefore, any just action in the school must be deemed ethical at \nthe individual and systems level.  This is not to be confused with consensus building, as that \nethical approach tends to tilt in the direction of the most powerful agent or stagnates through \nassimilation within the system.  \nThis ethical stance in a school can be incredibly complex and stifling, yet it is not a \nreason for inaction.  Participants in schools are always contributing.  The dialogical nature of \npursuing personally and socially just behaviors, therefore, suggests that curiosity, connectedness, \nco-regulation, and compassion must repeatedly filter any action on behalf of the student or \nschool environment.  \nThe Counseling Relationship\nPenetrating through the middle of the 5 Cs of ASE theory is its adherence to the common \nfactors of counseling literature (Wampold, 2015).  This literature suggests that a particular theory \nonly accounts for a small amount of client development.  Instead, factors external to the \ncounseling process largely dictate client outcomes; from an ASE perspective, this point endorses \nthe role of the school counselor as social justice advocate.  Within the counseling relationship, \ncommon factors are certain qualities that contribute to desirable outcomes across theoretical \norientations.  \nIn a counterintuitive way, the common factors literature supports the uniqueness of ASE \ntheory.  One of the primary predictors of counselor influenced outcomes pertains to the cultural \nfitness of the intervention.  As such, it is reasonable that the most appropriate approach to \nworking with students, educators, and other stakeholders in schools is through the application of \nan approach tailored to the culture of schools, the developmental and functional needs of \nstudents, and the roles and responsibilities endemic to school counselors.  \n\nMore than a tacit endorsement of ASE, the common factors literature explicitly highlights \nthe importance of rapport as a healing ingredient (Wampold, 2015).  The 5 Cs of ASE are the \nmechanism proscribed to establish mutual respect and to engender hopefulness in the client, \nwhich prove to be vital ingredients in counseling rapport. \nConcluding Thoughts \nSchool counselors operate in complex school systems.  At their disposal includes various \ndelivery systems to help support students and other parties, including classroom guidance and \npsychoeducational activities, small group counseling, individual counseling, coordination and \ncollaboration, and consultation.  Filtered through an ASE framework, each of these counseling \nformats can potentially support students and elements of the school environment as \ninterdependent governors of experience.  \nThe ASE perspective can appear almost paradoxical.  On the one hand, an ASE \npractitioner is required to act with (or within) a student\u2019s perspective.  This suggests a deep \nrespect for the current functioning of the client.  If there are any maladies, those are honored as \ncomponents of one\u2019s experience.  On the other hand, to be with the student as a counselor \nsuggests, one must ameliorate the experiences of the student and the school environment. \nThere is a resolution.  Unlike allied theoretical approaches that suggest a change in \nperspective or encourage the student to renarrative one\u2019s constructed messages, the ASE \napproach is primarily concerned with creating the personal and social conditions as preventative \npositions pointing towards ongoing development.  Stated more simply, school counseling reflects \nthe acme of education, that is pulling from one\u2019s history and compelling the self to be an active \nparticipant in that unfolding history.  As one\u2019s capacities are sharpened in the various counseling \n\nexperiences and as social circumstances in the school are made more equitable and usable, the \nself within systems emerge in more intended and prosperous ends. \nIt still feels like a volitional choice directed by the student.  The causal conditions of \nchoice were established in the student as an indivisible system and the school as another aspect \nof myriad systems.  There is a type of epistemological compatibilism in this resolve in that each \nstudent can affect one\u2019s destiny as it unfolds, but only insofar as those actions were enacted prior \nto their occurrence in the school.  The student\u2019s acumen as a reader and their exposure to \nempowering contexts contributes to one\u2019s moral compass.  How one engages in peer \ncommunication coupled with the peers in one\u2019s social groups affects what notes are or are not \npassed in geometry class. \nThe school counselor stands alongside each student and the total school environment.  \nLike all other governors in the kaleidoscope that is the school environment, the school \ncounselor\u2019s own orientation and practices contribute to future possibilities.  The spirit of ASE \ncan be best summarized in the following two quotes: \n\u201cTo best prepare young children in poverty for later life challenges, professional \ncounselors must make every attempt to improve social conditions; however, it is equally \nimportant that young children\u2019s internal capacities be strengthened either to \naccommodate improved social conditions or to maximize resilience in the face of \npersistent adversity\u201d (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2018, p. 299). \nand \n\u201cstudents from disenfranchised communities do not accept inadequate or deleterious \nsocial conditions; instead, using\u2026 strategies, they accept their cognitive and affective \n\nreactions and respond with clearer intentionality.\u201d (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2018, p. \n299) \n\nReferences\nAbdelghani, R., Oudeyer, P.

Lemberger-Truelove\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8916-9678\n\nChapter 11 Abstract\nIn this chapter, the author describes and provides examples of ASE school counseling practices.  \nExamples includes how an ASE orientation affects the use of classical counseling skills.  Also, in \nthis chapter is a five-session school counselor led consultation intervention, intended for K12 \nclassroom teachers.  Each of these practice examples have been used in K12 schools and \nempirically tested in rigorous counseling trials. The ASE examples illustrate conceptual and \npractice elements endemic to ASE theory, including the influence co-determination of \nexperience between students and educators (or other aspects of the school environment).\n\nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) school counseling theory is primarily \nconcerned with creating the conditions for students to thrive in K12 education contexts \n(Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014).  The individual student is conceptualized as \nan amalgamation of various personal and social ingredients.  Therefore, student development can \nbe accomplished by cultivating characteristics inbuilt to the student and by succoring features in \nthe environment.  In this chapter, we will introduce a few example behaviors school counselors \ncan utilize at the individual level and an example of an intervention approach intended to support \nthe broader school environment.  \nThe ASE counseling behaviors provided in this chapter are only a small sample of many \nexpressions that a school counselor can use to support a student or other members of the school \ncommunity.  The practice of ASE can be accomplished using manualized intervention protocols, \nsemi-structured activities, spontaneous counseling dialogue aimed at an individual or groups of \npeople, or advocacy behaviors pointed at features in and beyond the immediate school context.  \nWhat is consistent across the various types of intervention behaviors is a certain ASE orientation.  \nAn ASE orientation is receptive to the various experiences, interpretations, and possibilities \ngermane to the individual while maintaining that all individual experience is bound to a vast \nkaleidoscope of influencing systems.  The orientation is also optimistic and empowering, yet \nearnest in a commitment to personal development that is complimented by change in the various \nsocial structures that affect students.  Finally, an ASE orientation is relevant to everyday wisdom \nand pragmatic behaviors; the process and the outcome of school counseling are compatible, \ntherefore counseling practice must reflect the lives, values, and aspirations of the various people \nserved. \nIndividual Advocacy Behaviors\n\nIn practice, counseling behaviors inspired by one counseling theory can seem compatible \nwith counseling behaviors inspired by other (even diametrically opposite) counseling theories.  \nThis is not terribly surprising given many western counseling theories were intended to support \nclients in similar settings (i.e., often clinical psychological treatment environments).  Also, most \ncontemporary counseling theories generally emerged from corresponding cultural and \nphilosophical influences (e.g., post-enlightenment conceptions of an autonomous and volitional \nself, mind-body dualism).  In many ways, even though ASE theory is specific to school \nenvironments and operates from nascent philosophic assumptions, the practice can be compatible \nwith several classical theoretical approaches, especially when working directly with a certain \nindividual in a school context.  This is not to suggest that ASE is technically eclectic, sans a \ndistinct epistemological and practice foundation; instead, ASE theory can draw from customary \ncounseling behaviors and filter out in unique ways that are uniquely relevant to students in \nschool environments.  \nThe ways that counseling behaviors emerge from the various counseling theories are \noften subtle and only discerned through a deep scrutiny.  ASE theory shares beliefs and \nbehaviors with many classical approaches but is nonetheless different enough to conceptualized \nand implemented as a standalone approach.  In Figure 10.1, three of the most prominent \ncounselling paradigms are introduced as a way to compare and contrast with ASE theory.  \nFigure 10. 1\nCounseling Theory Comparison \nHumanistic counseling (e.g., person-centered, existential, gestalt, experiential) assumes the innate \ngoodness in people who are endowed with responsibility and the free will to pursue personal and social \nwellness (Schneider, Pierson, & Bugental, 2014).  The practice of humanistic counseling generally \npertains to the here-and-now experiences of the client as supported by a counselor who prizes authentic \ntherapeutic rapport.  \nCognitive-behavioral counseling (CBT) (e.g., rational emotive behavior, cognitive, third wave, \nbehavior modification) is a suite of approaches that suggest that people hold and express cognitive \ndistortions (thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and their associated behaviors that can result in disturbed \n\nsymptoms or broader core pathologies (Dobson & Dozois, 2019).  The practice of CBT includes \nspontaneous and structured interventions that typically pertain to challenging irrational or maladaptive \nthoughts, feelings, or behaviors and replace these irrational assumptions with more coherent \nexpressions. \nPost-modern counseling approaches (e.g., narrative, relational-cultural, constructivist) are based on \nthe philosophical belief that there are multiple truths, often affiliated with subjective personal positions \nand/or distributed social influences (Anderson, 2015).  Post-modern practices encourage flexible \ninterpretations of experience while challenging potentially oppressive and harmful environmental \nconditions.  \nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory pertains to school counseling and \nadherents aim to amplify students\u2019 and other school stakeholders\u2019 capacities while \nsimultaneously pursuing more hospital and contributory school climates. ASE is similar to \nhumanistic approaches concern with relationship building and here-and-now experiences; it is \ncompatible with CBT\u2019s use of meta-cognition to untether personal and social influences that \naffect student and systems outcomes; and ASE is germane to the multiplicity of identity and \noptions, as consistent with post-modern approaches.  What distinguishes ASE as a theory for \npractice is the requirement that all interventions are reciprocal at the individual and systems \nlevel and, second, the non-dual assumptions of self and volition. Consequentially, ASE is \ngenerally more focused on preventative and advocacy behaviors, as compared to classical \ncounseling theoretical approaches that are chiefly concerned with responding to the \npsychology of the individual.\nMany classical theories are readied with specialized techniques that emerge from the \nphilosophical assumptions endemic to each of these approaches.  Further, counseling theories \ncan alter how trans-theoretical skills are expressed.  Two of the most foundational counseling \nbehaviors that are present virtually every counseling theory includes a reflection of a client\u2019s \nfeelings and open-ended questions.  The following examples elucidate how these general \ncounseling behaviors are expressed differently based on their influencing counseling theory: \nReflecting Feelings\nHumanistic counseling: \nExample 1: As we are talking about your parents, I can see the profound grief that you\u2019re \nexperiencing (empathy). This is more than a memory, but a feeling that you carry with \nyou even now in this room after all these years (here-and-now; experiential). \nExample 2: I noticed you pulled backed when I said that; fearful of what you\u2019re \nexperiencing now as we talk about what you experienced in the past (here-and-now; \nimmediacy & authentic experience) \nCognitive behavioral counseling: \n\nExample 1: Witnessing the grief of others (activating event) reminds the struggles you \nendured after your own parents passed away, and now you believe that you will never \nescape the feelings of despair (beliefs), which in turn compels you to limit your \ninteractions with other people in your life (consequence). \nExample 2: You attach shame to your experiences of grief; a belief which has haunted \nyou for decades (Core belief)\nPost-modern counseling: \nExample 1: The grief still persists from the loss of your parents; some days are better than \nothers (deconstruction; dominant story; externalizing). This illustrates that you are more \nthan your grief, you are someone who can suffer deeply and also someone who \nexperiences deep joy (reauthoring).  \nAdvocating Student-with-Environment:\nExample 1: You\u2019re experience of grief (curiosity and connectedness) affects you deeply \n(compassion) and in different ways across different circumstances (co-regulation). \nExample 2: The loss you experienced is associated with a feeling of distress, yet sadness \nis coupled with this profound passion to support your family members as they are also \ngrieving (contribution).  \nQuestions:\nHumanistic counseling: \nExample 1: How does reflecting on the past affect you in this moment? (here-and-now; \nexperiential)\nExample 2: You\u2019ve endured much and I witness your resilience.  In a similar way, I \nwonder what you learned about yourself?  (meaning)\nExample 3: You work hard to maintain your composure, but what is your fidgeting knee \ntell us if it could speak?  (somatic here-and-now)   \nCognitive behavioral counseling: \nExample 1: (downward arrow) 1) Can you tell me what you experienced when you were \ntaking the test?  (minor mode) 2) Okay, so felt anxious because you had the impression \nthat you were not performing well after much preparation. If true, from your perspective, \nwhat does this experience tell you about yourself as a learner?  (protoschema) 3) So you \ninterpreted this one anxiety laden experience as reflective of your total ability as a \nlearner.  How might you then describe yourself as a learner generally?  4) You have this \ncircular experience, you believe that you are incapable of learning even when preparing, \nwhich leads to anxiety in performance situations, contributing to undesirable learning \noutcomes and now this larger belief that you are unable to learn or demonstrate your \nlearning?  (core belief)\nPost-modern counseling: \n\nExample 1: I wonder how someone else might interpret this experience in class. Think of \nthe most charitable person you know, if she or he knew how anxious you were in class \nhow might they interpret your performance after studying so many hours? (externalizing)\nExample 2: Let\u2019s not disregard this recent episode, but let\u2019s also not focus only here.  \nCould you describe to me some occasions when you had a different experience in a \nsimilar situation? (exceptions)\nAdvocating Student-with-Environment:\nExample 1: What aspects from your classroom experiences most affect how you \nparticipate as a student (curiosity, co-regulation, and contribution)?  \nExample 2: Who in class is most helpful when you are struggling (co-regulation)?  \nExample 3: How might you notice when your attention starts to get distracted (co-\nregulation)?  What things typically occur in class when you start to experience distraction \n(curiosity)? \nTo further illustrate how ASE theory employs reflections of feelings and questions to \nsupport the development of children, I (Matthew) was supervising my five-year-old son and his \n4-year-old cousin.  After a few normal disagreements, my son said that he wanted to play by \nhimself, assumingly to avoid further conflict.  This greatly disappointed my nephew who \napparently felt rejected and angry, as he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t play with me, I am going to hit you.\u201d  \nMy response to my nephew was something like the following: \nMatthew:  I see that you\u2019re quite angry when Atom (my son) said that he wanted to play \nalone.  You were so upset that you said you\u2019re going to hit him.\nNephew:  Yes, I am so angry at Atom. \nMatthew:  I wonder if you can tell me all of the different things that you can do when you \nget this angry?  \nNephew: (listed about 3 strategies his parents had formerly introduced)\nMatthew:  That\u2019s a lot of ways to express anger; I wonder which ones might make you \nfeel just a little bit better?\u201d\n\nIn this short example, ASE concepts such as co-regulation and the prior determinants of \nexperience are evident.  Rather than discounting either child\u2019s feelings, experiences, or desires, \nthe intention of my response was to recruit from those prior determinants and refocus them in a \nmanner that is more consistent with each child\u2019s intended outcome.  At the same time, each child \nis situated in a relationship with the other child, therefore personal desires must be distributed \nand reconsidered as they are compliant to the desires and actions of others.  \nFrom an ASE perspective, each individual counseling intervention is conceived and \npracticed from a systems perspective.  It is essential that the school counselor does not approach \nthe individual student, educator, or other stakeholder with a fixed or hierarchical perspective.  \nEven when utilizing one of the various behaviors or aphorisms associated with ASE theory.  \nWhen working with the individual, counseling behaviors are not intended proffered in a self-\nsustaining manner, rather individual intervention is intended embolden the individual as an \nactive and able agent in their social system.  This orientation can be captured in the following \nASE aphorism:  \u201cI alone didn\u2019t create my circumstance, but I can affect how I internalize and \nexpress myself.\u201d \nSystemic Advocacy Behaviors\nTo illustrate how a school counselor can support student development through influence \nat the environment (systemic) level, we present a series of school counselor led consultation \nsessions that are aimed at supporting classroom teachers from an ASE perspective.  Consultation \nis when a school counselor delivers content to one person or group with the intention that that \nperson or group will utilize the content to support another person not generally involved in the \ninitial consultation activities (Baker et al., 2009).  The practice of consultation suggests that the \ncontent can be amplified to various individuals and settings, as the person engaged in the actual \n\nconsultation activities will be subsequently exposed to various individuals.  Stated otherwise, the \nvalue in the content and the reach of the school counselor is amplified beyond the contact with a \nsingle recipient; instead, the efforts of the school counselor have the potential to reverberate \nthrough the consultee repeatedly.  \nConsultation is one of many strategies that a school counselor might utilize to advocate \nfor more facilitative school environmental conditions.  There are certainly other approaches to \nadvocacy, not limited to political advocacy that might shape education and public policy, engage \nwith community partners that might generate more active allies in schools, or raise awareness \nabout the processes and outcomes of structural inequality and mistreatment.  While each of these \nactivities is potentially invaluable, consultation is uniquely orientated to empowering members \nof the social system to act on behalf of the needs of students and school systems.  This feature of \nconsultation is particularly consistent with the spirit of ASE theory, as consultation has the \npotential to result in reciprocal benefits for the consultee and students.  Further, consultation is \nby its nature generative and adaptive, and it can adjust over time and across circumstances \nrelative to how the content is internalized and actualized by the consultee.   \nIt is for these reasons that consultation was chosen as one exemplar ASE practice.  ASE \ncan be delivered in various ways \u2013 such as individual counseling with a student, teacher, \nguardian, etc. or group counseling in and out of classrooms \u2013 but consultation most clearly \nreflects the ASE position that cultivating personal capacities can affect total systems. In this way, \nthis chapter includes a five-consultation session unit that was used and empirically tested an \neconomically challenged middle school (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2023).  Findings from the \nconsultation intervention delivered by 9 middle school classroom teachers (and their 149 \nstudents) included significant change in teachers\u2019 perceptions of the teacher\u2013student relationship \n\nthat predicted students\u2019 perception of the same relationship. Results from the study also \ndemonstrated similar coregulated changes in two curiosity scales and a small change in teachers\u2019 \nstress tolerance from the pre- to post-test data collection periods. These results provide some \ninferential evidence that the ASE approach can affect personal development (for the teacher \nconsultees) and system change (the relationships shared between teachers and students).  \nIt is important to note that there are some unique features to this particular consultation \nexample.  First, the words provided below are semi-scripted and therefore more directive as \ncompared to many other ASE interventions.  ASE theory is generally complaint to direct and \nindirect practices (e.g., psychoeducational or spontaneous counseling sessions), yet in practice \nASE is predominately student- or teacher-centered whereby the person served dictates much of \nthe content and process.  In the case of the consultation example used in this chapter, a more \ndirective approach was identified to better illustrate the concepts and should not be confused as \nthe ideal or even standard approach to practice.  Second, these consultation sessions were \ndelivered exclusively to classroom teachers and yet the acme ASE intervention would include \nsomething like these sessions delivered to teachers and complimentary sessions delivered to \nstudents in classrooms.  Hopefully a school counselor can cultivate a reciprocal and dynamic \nclimate shared between students, educators, and other members of the school community.  Third, \nany intervention requires priming the participants, relationship building, and follow-up, all \ninferred in the current example but not fully elaborated in the text.  For example, each of these \nsessions includes a mindfulness activity that can be confused with forced self-care activities \noften pushed onto teachers without their discretion.  Certainly, mindfulness and ASE in general \naspire toward a greater feeling of equanimity, but that is not the primary intent; instead\n\nThe consultation intervention included a mindfulness lesson in each session, but the \nparticular mindfulness activities were not necessarily focused on stress reduction but \nchiefly concerned teachers\u2019 awareness of experience and intentional teaching behaviors. \nLemberger-Truelove et al., 2023, p. 7 \nAgain, the general purpose of ASE is to elucidate how experiences are internalized, embodied, \nand then shared; moreover, ASE pertains to how we are more than passive recipients of \nexperience, and with intentional intervention we can co-determine new possibilities.   \n\nWeek One: Beginnings\nSchool Counselor: \n\u201cThank you for coming today, I know your time is valuable, and I hope that the times that we \nshare over the following 5 weeks will be worth the investment, with clear benefits to you and \nyour students.  These are incredibly challenging times for educators and our meetings might \nprovide you an opportunity to explore how these challenges have affected you and further \nexplore new insights and responses to challenges in and beyond the classroom. \nOur work together is not therapy in the classical sense, rather this is consultation. Consultation is \nintended to support a person who will in turn use those experiences to support someone else.  In \nour case, hopefully what we do here between you and me will have direct effects on your \nexperiences in the classroom and how you support your students\u2019 development.  This said, \nalmost all effective consultation reflects the processes and outcomes of therapy, including the \ndisclosing of personal information or the experience of intense emotions.  With this in mind, it is \nessential that we establish some ground rules for our active participation in these sessions. \nFirst, including this session, there will be five 30-minute consultation sessions. In these sessions \nwe will establish a generic structure that I will facilitate, but much of the content will be dictated \nby your experiences and disclosures. We will begin each session with a brief breathing exercise \nintended to help focus our attention here and engage a mindset of mutual openness and growth. \nThen we will ask if there are any persistent or concerning professional experiences that you\u2019d \nlike to discuss.  In the absence of anything specific, I have some prepared language devices \ninspired by research on social and emotional learning practices in school settings.  \nEither using your experiences or these imported language devises, we will spend some time \nexploring how your initial impressions are valid and how alternative responses might add new \nways to approach your experiences with others. Second, in each session we will spend a few \nminutes discussing tangible strategies to improve the social and working conditions as an \neducator. Rather than commiserating on unattainable goals for change, we will try and narrow on \nimmediate and attainable outcomes with measured implications you can experience directly and \nutilize immediately. Then, we will spend approximately 10 minutes each week engaged in a brief \nmindfulness activity.  In this activity, we will use our breath to consider the various thoughts that \narise, explore our reactions to these thoughts, and on occasion encourage curiosity and diverse \nresponses to future experiences. \nFinally, privacy is vital to the success of this consultation experience.  Because we are in small \ngroups with me and your peer teachers, I cannot promise total secrecy, but it is important that we \nmake a formal commitment to keep what is said in here between us and in this context only, into \nperpetuity. As the lead consultant, my commitment to confidentiality is an ethical and legal \nrequirement; anything you mention during our time together will be confidential, that is it is \nprivate and I will not share anything stated with other staff, faculty, or administrators on campus. \nI will uphold confidentiality and would request you do the same to keep the integrity of our work \ntogether. However, in cases of child abuse, neglect, exploitation or intent to harm another person \nor yourself, I am required by law to report it to the appropriate authority. Are there any \nquestions?\u201d \n\nTeachers: \n(Response).\nSchool Counselor:\nBefore we begin, I want to provide you with an opportunity to ask any questions about any of the \nintroductions, including the duration and structure of sessions, issues pertaining to \nconfidentiality, or the nature of consultation.  Any questions or thoughts? \nTeachers: \n(Response)\nSchool Counselors:\nGiven what we have discussed, are you willing to consent to participation in these consultation \nsessions?  We can revisit this commitment at any point.  \nTeachers: \n(Obtain verbal consent).\nSchool Counselor:\nAs mentioned, I would like for each of us to begin this meeting with a brief breathing exercise \nintended to focus our attention here together.  With this in mind, I encourage you to close your \neyes and simply bring your awareness to your breath.  Make no effort to change your natural \nbreathing at this point, simply notice that you are breathing.  Notice that this breath sustains your \nlife and is something shared between you and the world around you.  Try not and judge the \nquality of your breath, again simply experience it for the next 10 or so seconds. \n(provide the teachers about 10 seconds)\nOkay, perfect.  Keep your eyes closed and continue to breathe in a natural way.  It has been said, \n\u201cAs long as you are breathing, there is more right with you than wrong, regardless of what is \ngoing on in your life.\u201d  \nWhile maintaining an awareness on your breath, I now invite you to take five intentional, deep \nbreaths.  If comfortable, take approximately a second or more to inhale, a second or more to fully \nexhale, and then just a short instance between each of the five breaths.  Continue to be present \nwith this deeper breathing, adding no additional mental reflection or commentary; simply sustain \nan open attention to your breath.\nOnce you are complete with these five breaths, slowly return to this moment by opening your \neyes and engaging back into your typical breathing patterns. \nBreathing is incredibly powerful and yet often neglected.  It is astounding that our noses are \nsituated right next to our brains, especially that front location called the prefrontal cortex, which \nis generally associated with how we regulate our experiences and make intentional decisions.  \nThis will set the tone for our experiences, namely accepting the inhale-breath as reflective of the \n\nvarious influences that are present in our world, the exhale-breath as how we share our reactions \nwith the world, and the brief pause in between as our quick and yet essential opportunity to \nreflect and create the next moment with intentionality and grace. \nLet\u2019s take no more than 3 minutes to share what it was like to breath together, whether you have \ndone things like this in the past or not is not necessarily important, we are interested in the \npresent experience of doing it there together. \n(3 to 5 minutes of teacher disclosure)\nSchool Counselor:\nBreathing is both an individual and group activity.  It is especially apparent in these times that \nbreathing is shared between people.  In this way, it is appropriate that we take about five minutes \ntotal and introduce ourselves and at least one thing we hope to get from these five consultation \nsessions.  I will begin by modeling and then I invite you to disclose as you feel fitting.  \n(Provide five minutes for the teachers to share)\nThank you. \nSchool Counselor:\nFor our first meeting, the content will be a bit different as compared to what will occur for the \nnext 4 meetings.  In the subsequent meetings, I anticipate that much of the content will be driven \nby what you bring for us to discuss whereas today I want to briefly set the tone for the \nphilosophy and practice behind this form of consultation.  We will use this content to inform our \nwork together. \nLet\u2019s start with a little thought experiment: Think about your thoughts before you think them.  \n(Give the teachers about 5 seconds to contemplate)\nOf course, this is an impossibility, you cannot think about a thought before you think it.  All \nthoughts are this way, we are experiencing thoughts as a reflection after their inception.  It feels \nas if we are creating thoughts before they occur, but this is an impossibility; rather we are \nobserving them after they manifest.  And if true, then where do they come from, these thoughts? \n(Give the teachers about 20 seconds to reflect and respond)\nLet\u2019s play with this idea a bit longer with another experiment.  Take just about 15 seconds to \nsimply pay attention to your thoughts.  Whatever the content, any thought is fine.  Simply \ncapture it.  Try not to attach any evaluation or judgment about the rightness or wrongness; \nsimply capture the thought.  \n(Give the teachers about 20 seconds to reflect and respond)\nThank you for giving these thought-experiments a try.  I am going to now take a couple of \nminutes to unpack how they pertain to our work together.  \n\nWith our thoughts, we often conflate the consequences of our thoughts with the causes of our \nthoughts. For example, in doing the thought experiment with you, my thought(s) was(were) \n(insert example), but upon deeper reflection that thought was informed by my personal \nbackground, the language I use, how my current day is going, values and hopes, and myriad \nother contributing influences.  \nWhen we experience only the consequence of a thought, we often inadvertently reduce it to the \nperceived cause.  There is some function in this, as humans we try to make predictions based on \nprior causes and how they might likely lead to predictable consequences. But there is a shadow \nside, we tend to get rather algorithmic and rigid in our thinking, often missing the various causes \nor multiple consequences.  \nIn action, this means we react, rather than respond.  To react is to act again. There is a lot of \nwisdom and functionality in this. It is efficient, we don\u2019t have to exhaust a lot of effort to be \ninfluenced by a prior cause or react in a familiar way.  But as a habit, simply reacting can also \nlimit us.  \nLast exercise before we transition to our final two activities.  Briefly write down one example of \nsomething that has affected your stress as a teacher in the recent past, preferably today or in the \nlast week. \nTry not to write any evaluations or judgements about these experiences, simply write them as \nobjective experiences.  Use no more than a single sentence.  After this is complete, then take just \na few minutes to sketch out as many of the things that contributed to this event or experience.  \nOscillate between things that you contribute to this experience and things outside of yourself.  \nAnd then write out some of the things that preceded and contributed to these causes.  Take about \n3 minutes to accomplish this task. (verbally provide them an example from your life while they \nwrite)\nNow, look at your sketches.  See how each consequence is reasonable given the causes; this isn\u2019t \nto suggest that the consequence is right (or wrong), good or bad, but how it follows coherently \nbetween causes and effects.  Now look at the list and see if there is one or more causes that can \nbe altered; this doesn\u2019t mean that it was right or wrong, good or bad; rather it is simply \nsomething that you have the ability to easily manipulate without much effort or sacrifice.  It can \nbe as provocative as having a completely different instigating cause or as subtle as having a \ndifferent perspective on the same cause. \n \nToday, as you are confronted with novel experiences and thoughts, take a moment to briefly \nengage in this practice.  \u201cHow am I reacting, what prior causes (personal and environmental) \ninfluence me to react this way?  And while I accept my reaction as reasonable, I also accept that \nI can respond differently and contribute to a new possible outcome; noticing however small or \ninfluential those new outcomes might be.\u201d \nTo help you do this, I encourage you to consider using this phrase as a reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t doubt \nmy ability, try a different strategy.\u201d  \n\nI want us to briefly transition to our second content portion.  Each session we will do something \nlike the prior portion to support you in how you experience things internally and then we will do \nsomething to help influence your environment.  It is wrongheaded to think that things will \nimprove by simply altering one\u2019s orientation.  As a teacher, your feelings of stress are real as are \nthe things that contribute to these feelings.  Students can be stressful. Administration or peers can \nbe stressful.  Policy can be stressful.  Even our lives outside of our jobs can affect the stress we \nexperience in our work.  Stress is a natural physiological and psychological experience.  \nI want us to think of one thing that affects our stresses as educators, something that is particular \nto our school.  Let\u2019s not judge it as good or bad at this point, let\u2019s simply identify it.  Let\u2019s \nidentify something that we think has various causes but consequences that affect our \nperformance and experience as teachers.  Over the next four weeks we are going to explore the \ncauses and consequences of this stressor and pursue specific behaviors, together as a team, to \nmake the school culture a little better, less stressful, and more connected. \n(take 5 minutes to explore and commit)\nThank you.  While we might not be able to completely change the working conditions, we might \nbe able to alter some aspects that might in turn contribute to more helpful learning and working \nconditions.  Just as earlier we used the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t doubt my ability, try a different strategy\u201d to \naffect our internal thoughts, I offer another one for how we as a team might approach our work \nin advocating for a stronger school culture: \u201cLittle by little, bit by bit, we are improving \neveryday.\u201d  Pursuing, noticing, and accomplishing a series of small and yet important \nimprovements is a way of affecting causes leading to new consequences in and beyond our \nshared school environment.  \nFinally, I want us to take five minutes to close with our first formal mindfulness exercise.  You \nmight have some prior experiences with mindfulness, whether formal practice or things you have \nheard or read about.  Consistent with our prior activity, I am going to ask you to not import any \njudgment or impressions related to prior experiences with mindfulness, instead I encourage you \nto approach this opportunity as novel as is possible.  I am going to read my mindfulness script \nand support you as much as is possible.    \nSchool Counselor:\nASE Meditation 1\nAs a teacher, we rely on our intuitions and rapid recall and expertise.  There are myriad people \nand events, always pining for our attention.  Teachers are human, beautifully so; and like all \nhumans, our capacity to be fully intentional is often limited.  \nThe great developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik commented that young children are like \nlanterns who distribute light broadly so to witness and have access to as many things as \npossible, for the more experiences at one\u2019s disposal, the greater number of things we can draw \nfrom to operate on own worlds later in life.  This is different than adults, who are like \nflashlights, focusing light to specific apertures with targeted intention.  We do this to be \n\nefficient because we\u2019d be overwhelmed if we were constantly accumulating and processing \ndisturbed experiences.  As teachers, we must be like lanterns and flashlights, oscillating \nbetween the expanse of curiosity and creativity and intentional focus.   \nIn our practices together, we are going to play around with these ideas, that is oscillating \nbetween expanding our awareness and curiosity and bringing back specific and useful details \ninto intentional focus.   To do this, we are going to use some practices associated with \nmindfulness, tailored specifically to working with children especially as an educator and in a \nschool environment.  Many of you have had experiences with mindfulness, and while these \npast experiences with mindfulness might range from helpful to challenging and while such \npast experiences will certainly affect your experiences with our exercises together, it might be \nhelpful to suspend memory as much as is possible, begin anew with our work together now, as \na lantern garnering new opportunities.   \nThis first practice will be rather short.  But I encourage you to consider the transferability of \nthese short practices, especially in your busy day as a teacher.  It is often suggested that one \nmust practice many hours to become an expert, and while there is much wisdom in practice; in \nthe current context, we are simply practicing attention to one\u2019s experiences, and there is no \ngreater expert on you than you.  These short practices are designed so that you can get back to \nyou, be the expert of you, especially when the environment around you can be challenging and \neven stressful. \nOur practice today will be especially brief and each week we will add a bit more time and \nfocus.  This week we will play around with the concept of personal and social curiosity.  For \nour purposes, we will define curiosity as the pursuit of new information or experiences, where \nnovel and surprising outcomes are anticipated and prized.  \nIf you are standing, please take a seat or if you are already seated, take a moment to become \naware of the sensation of sitting.  It is generally helpful to sit as comfortably as you can, in \nwhatever way has a history of keeping you tranquil and yet attentive. \nAs you focus your gentle awareness on sitting. Perhaps take a few deep breaths.  Become \naware of the sensations of breathing.  You need not force anything. Simply observe.  Notice \nwhere you feel the breath most clearly; it could be the tip of the nose, possibly the rise and fall \nof the abdomen or chest.  Where you identify the sensation of your breath is personal and it \ncan change as you continue to attend. \n15 seconds\nBreath is always with us.  There is no need to alter the quality of your breathing for this \nexercise.  Simply observe it.  Notice all aspects of the breath, including the initial contact of \nthe air outside of you to your skin, follow where it moves to in your body, and as it exits, and \nthe pauses between breaths. \nContinue to breathe in a normal and comfortable manner and notice any thoughts, feelings, or \nsensations that might arise.  Regardless of the content of these inner mental experiences, open \n\nup to them with curiosity.  They are neither good nor bad, right nor wrong, simply attend to \nthese thoughts.  You might ask yourself, are there many thoughts, a single theme of thoughts, \nor maybe something like both myriad thoughts inspired by a single theme.  Simply breathe and \nappreciate that you are the sole expert of your inner experiences.  \nTake a moment to inquire into the genesis of these inner mental experiences.  Did you think of \nthem before you thought them?  More likely, you observed them after they are perceptible.  \nNotice the relationship between the sensations of sitting and breathing, the sensation of \nattending to oneself in a curious way, and the cascade of thoughts that capture us.  \nWhen thoughts or feelings creep in, simply acknowledge them with brief momentary curiosity \nand then return to the breath.  \nWhen comfortable, comfortably expand your awareness back to the surroundings.  To the \ncounselor you are working with and the room that surrounds you.  \nThe distinguished psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett offers the following wisdom: \u201cIn every \nwaking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions \nand give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your \nbrain constructs instances of emotion.\"\nThis brief practice we shared is an introduction in how one might interrogate how the brain \nuses our mind to organize and respond to our experiences.  As teachers, especially during \nthese inauspicious times, with many personal, professional, and social threats, it might be \nhelpful to be curious about the infancy of our experiences, especially our emotions.  While \ncapturing our emotions will not necessarily remove or even alter the characters of these \nthreats; it is possible that our curiosity is the first step in engaging in responding with \nflexibility and intention, rather than reacting.\nThis week you will find yourself back in your familiar classroom.  While it might be infeasible \nto dedicate 5 to 10 minutes to capture your breath as we did; do invest in 3 to 5 intentional \nbreaths with curiosity, interrogate where any thoughts might have come from, and return to the \nclassroom with intention and compassion for oneself and others.   \nSchool Counselor:\nAs we close, I want to encourage you to think about one thing that stood out and affected you \ntoday in our session.  Commit to one very specific behavior that you can use this strategy \nimmediately.  How will you know when to use this strategy, how will you know if it was helpful, \nand if helpful how will you reinforce and celebrate your commitment or if it didn\u2019t help how can \nyou try a different strategy?  \nFinally, I want to encourage each of you to consider downloading an app called \u201cHealthy Minds \nProgram,\u201d that is free for either Apple or Android.  While not necessarily required, it is a great \nresearch-supported program that is consistent with the practices we will be doing and therefore \n\nlikely deepen the outcomes of our efforts here.  Thank you again and I greatly look forward to \nseeing you again this time next week. \n\nSession Two\nSchool Counselor\nAs we begin our work today, I want to briefly start by asking if you have any questions about the \ncomposition of these consultation sessions or revisit the confidentiality promise and limitations. \nTeachers\nAllow 1 minute (or more if needed based on the teachers\u2019 queries)\nSchool Counselor:\nSimilar to last week, I would like for each of us to begin this meeting with a brief breathing \nexercise intended to focus our attention here together.  With this in mind, I encourage you to \nclose your eyes and simply bring your awareness to your breath.  Make no effort to change your \nnatural breathing at this point, simply notice that you are breathing.  Notice that this breath \nsustains your life and is something shared between you and the world around you.  Try not and \njudge the quality of your breath, again simply experience it for the next 10 or so seconds. \n(provide the teachers about 10 seconds)\nI: Teacher Self-Advocacy\nSchool Counselor\nToday I want to introduce the concept of radical curiosity and offer some very specific strategies \ninformed by the empirical and conceptual literature pertaining to social and emotional learning to \nhelp us accomplish this radical curiosity. The hope is that we can apply these radical curiosity \nstrategies, resulting in new insights and new more desirable outcomes. \nCuriosity is a \u201cdrive state for information\u201d (Kidd & Hayden, p. 450); as a practice, curiosity is a \nnon-evaluative expression of inquisitiveness about a person and/or circumstance.  In this way, \nthe outcome of curiosity is not the acquisition of an unchanging or even ideal end, rather a \npersistent openness to ongoing development.  For example, \u201cWhat did you accomplish?\u201d is only \nminimally curious whereas \u201cHow did you experience your accomplishments?\u201d In both brief \nprompts, you can receive specific information about the accomplishment but only in the latter \nquestion does the prompt encourage elaboration beyond an isolated circumstance. \nTo be curious, it is often helpful to interrogate some of the things that contribute to our own \ninner conversations. This process of interrogation requires first, self-awareness, and then, second, \nself-management. Self-awareness is becoming more aware of our culture, thoughts, feelings, and \npotential whereas self-management is how we intentionally affect our emotions, thoughts, and \nactions to achieve goals, coping with stress, preserving.  \nLet\u2019s practice two language devises to generate curiosity through self-awareness and -\nmanagement, namely a reflection of feeling and an open-ended question. \n(Encourage one teacher to interface with another)\n\nA reflection of feelings is identifying the emotional experience of another person and sharing it \nwith this person to demonstrate empathy, understanding, and connection.  This requires you to \naccurately receive and articulate the emotion and couple it with a causal anchor affiliated with \nthe person\u2019s emotional experience.  Here are a couple of examples:  \n\uf0b7\nJanelle, you are feeling frustrated because the number of responsibilities you have as a \nteacher seems to exceed your time or resources.\n\uf0b7\nI can see how happy you are when you work really hard and identify one of many possible \nsolutions that might work for you.  \nA second skill to generate curiosity is a non-evaluative, reflective question. These open-ended \nquestions should be more than a re-quest for information, rather a way to evince that you are \ncurious about the other person\u2019s lived experience:\n\uf0b7\nWhat is it like for you to be experiencing these frustrations as a relatively new teacher?\n\uf0b7\nHow did the APs statement affect your remainder of the day in class? \n\uf0b7\nWhen you are feeling motivated, what are some typical things that inspire these feelings? \nLet\u2019s take a couple of minutes and practice these reflections and questions a few times.  \n(allow 2 minutes for each teacher to practice one or two each, with you offering non-evaluative \nhelp if requested)\nThese language strategies can be used for our own internal dialogue but also can be used as \nconversation devices when we interact with students, colleagues, or parents.  Let\u2019s take a few \nminutes as a group and utilize each of these two skills.  Pair up and come up with some event \nthat occurred today in school.  It can be something troubling or even something banal and \nordinary.  With your partner, rather than trying to figure out an immediate solution, try and use \nboth reflections of feelings and open-ended questions to demonstrate curiosity.  I am here to help \nshould you need it.  \n(allow approximately 5 minutes)\nII: School Environment Advocacy\nOkay, great.  Let\u2019s shift our attention from our group to our broader school context.  Last week \nwe spoke about a possible event or phenomenon that is present in the school environment or \nculture; something that as a team we might be able to influence.  Let\u2019s take a few minutes to \ndiscuss some possibilities and using our concept of radical curiosity, and the skills of reflection \nand questions, what is some specific behaviors that we can do to start the process of climate \nchange in the school?  \nIII: Mindfulness Activity\nI want us to take about 10 minutes and participate in our second formal mindfulness exercise.  I \nam going to read a script and I encourage you to follow along as you find it comfortable and \nhelpful.  \n\nASE Meditation 2: \nWelcome back.  We genuinely hope that you found some value in the practice last week; in \nfact, we hope that the value inspired you to practice beyond these mere 10 minutes we share \ntogether.  As a counseling professor, I tell my students that the measure of effective therapy is \nnot found merely in the experiences during the 50-minute session but rather how that 50-\nminutes affects all of the minutes, hours, and days between and beyond sessions.  \nLast week we did a brief exercise of paying attention to your inner experiences, noticing how \nthoughts and feelings seem to emerge, and then evolve into other thoughts or feelings.  We \nalso briefly encouraged you to notice any evaluations that get overlayed on top of these \ntransitory mental experiences.  By distinguishing an experience from an evaluation, we might \nbe able to better regulate our experiences, discern what is acceptable, and prove decisive \nenough to act more intentionally and connected to others. \nThis week, we are going to take this practice one step further and encourage you to interrogate \nthese inner experiences, note the complexity of prior mental and environmental influencers \nthat contributed to the manifestation, and how to retain that balance between accepting our \ninner experiences are natural expressions.  In short, we accept that all responses are feasible, \nbut reacting in the same way over and over again potentially limits our choices and \nconsequences. \nLast week, when walking my 8-year old daughter to school she asked, \u201cdaddy, is it okay to be \nscared?\u201d And I responded something like, \u201cOf course, everyone gets scared from time to time.  \nIt is your body\u2019s way of telling you it feels threatened or unsure. Being scared can be a very \nhelpful feeling to keep us safe.  What is not helpful is that we behave the same way to \neverything that makes us scared. Sometimes when we are scared we need to run away, other \ntimes we need to protect ourselves, and sometimes it is okay to simply note that you felt \nsomething and that fear will soon go away and become something else.\u201d \nThis brief story reflects a helpful practice of differentiating reacting from responding.  To re-\nact is to act again, in a habituated way. To respond is to consider, however briefly, with \ncomplexity, acceptance of oneself, and discernment of various possibilities. As a teacher, we \nexperience a litany of emotions, often influenced by prior determinants outside of our \nconscious awareness and control.  It is okay to feel how we do in response to circumstance, \nbut it is also permissible and even helpful to come prepared with a diversity of responses to \ncircumstance.  In fact, research suggests that the more that we anticipate prior determinants of \nexperience, note that there are multiple determinants to any one or more experiences, and \npractice flexible responses, we generally have more internally useful ends.    \nRemember, our initial experiences are valid, but not fixed. Similarly, our evaluations we \noverlay experience have a basis in prior influences. As a practice, we can break them apart and \ninterrogate them for more intentional and helpful outcomes; but ultimately, they are both \nsimply the content of consciousness. We can observe them and by doing so, we are more \nlikely to create new determinants of experience.  \nIf you are standing, please take a seat or if you are already seated, take a moment to become \n\naware of the sensation of sitting.  It is generally helpful to sit as comfortably as you can, in \nwhatever way has a history of keeping you tranquil and yet attentive. \nAs you focus your gentle awareness on sitting. Perhaps take a few deep breaths.  Without too \nmuch effort, bring to memory any salient feeling that you experienced today.  Whatever first \ncomes to mind is perfect and you need not sift through multiple possibilities.  \nPress down on this recollection for a couple of seconds.  Where were you at?  What was \nhappening?  Was anyone else involved?  At this stage, effortlessly suspend any evaluation of \nthe experience or anything related to it; simply bracket your attention to the facts about how \nyou experienced whatever it is.  \nIn a similar way, take a few seconds and recall any events however small or influential that \ncontributed to the experience you noted. Even the most seemingly banal, insignificant, just \nobserve the experiences.  For example, returning to the story of my daughter and her inquiry \nabout fear.  Prior experiences might include being afraid the night before, messages she heard \nother say about being scared, what it means to disclose and inquire with her father.  As a \nteacher, you might have recalled something challenging or inspiring in the classroom or with \nan administrator. There are proximal determinants like the relationships that contributed to the \nexperience but more distal and abstract like your values in being a teacher that led you to the \nprofession.  Simply note all of them, quickly and without evaluation\u2026 all while retaining a \ngentle unforced pattern of breathing.  \n15 seconds\nAs you reflect on these causal agents of experience, did any standout?  Any surprise or affirm \nyou?  You can extend this beyond yourself and your determinants of experience.  For \nexample, if a student, parent, colleague or admin was a part of your memory, what prior \ndeterminants affected them and in turn contributed to your experience?  Suspend evaluation, \nsimply breathe and with each breath note that these are possible determinants that affect how \nwe respond to circumstance. \n10 seconds\nOur initial memory, the feelings and evaluations attached to them are not necessarily separate, \nas they are all content of our conscious experience.  But it can be helpful to disentangle their \nhold on us by pulling them apart, interrogating how causes contribute to consequences, noting \nthat there are various causes, and how we privilege certain causes.  \nIn accepting our thoughts and feelings, we are not passively accepting harmful things that \nhappen to us.  In a similar way, we don\u2019t accept that only helpful things will occur all of the \ntime.  Instead, we accept that our experiences are legitimate but the practice of breathing and \nreflection might contribute to more intentional, curious, flexible, and socially helpful \noutcomes. And when it doesn\u2019t immediately contribute, it makes us more likely to try \nsomething different until we do. Don\u2019t doubt one\u2019s ability, try another strategy. \n\nContinue to breathe in a normal and comfortable manner and notice any thoughts, feelings, or \nsensations that might arise.  \nWhen thoughts or feelings creep in, simply acknowledge them with brief momentary curiosity \nand then return to the breath.  \nWhen comfortable, comfortably expand your awareness back to the surroundings.  To the \ncounselor you are working with and the room that surrounds you.  \nThis week you will find yourself back in your familiar classroom.  While it might be infeasible \nto dedicate 5 to 10 minutes to capture your breath and interrogate every experience as we just \ndid together, but commit to something that is more feasible.  Is 15 seconds worth a different \noutcome?  5 seconds to breathe, 5 seconds to reflect on possible prior influences, and 5 \nseconds to consider how curious, flexible, and connected outcomes might manifest from your \ninvestment.\nThank you again for your practice and for all of the important work that you do as an educator.  \nThese are dubious times.  The purpose of these exercises is not to downplay the challenges \nyou have as a professional teacher or in any moment in a school, but instead it they are \nintended to empower you in the midst of any challenge and accomplishment.     \nIV: Closing\nReturn back to the group when comfortable.  As we close, I want to encourage you to think about \none thing that stood out and affected you today in our session.  Commit to one very specific \nbehavior that you can use this strategy immediately.  How will you know when to use this \nstrategy, how will you know if it was helpful, and if helpful how will you reinforce and celebrate \nyour commitment or if it didn\u2019t help how can you try a different strategy?  \n\nSession Three\nSchool Counselor\nLast week we talked about the concept of applied curiosity, that is how as educators we might \ninterrogate our own inner ways of processing experiences but also extending this introspective \nprocess outward to others.  Researchers consistently find that expressing respectful curiosity \ntends to lend to better relationships and a variety of valued student and teacher outcomes like \nimproved achievement, lower stress, and stronger classroom climates.  \nTo start this week, we will try and be curious with you about your experiences as an educator.  \nLet\u2019s take a moment and identify something that is affecting your experiences as an educator. \nThese need not be negative experiences, but don\u2019t feel inhibited to bring up something that you \nfeel comfortable talking about but might be compromising your experiences. Take no more than \n30 seconds, what first comes to mind is fine.  \n(Spend about 5 minutes listening, validating, and exploring their stories.  Use the reflective \nlistening skills explicated in Session Two and ASE counseling skills listed in the Chapter 10 of \nthis book)\nBuilding from curiosity, this week we are going to add to our concepts by adding co-regulation.  \nCo-regulation is the interface of two or more self-aware, intentional individuals who draw from \nvarious cultural, social, and personal sources to inform and influence behavior (McCaslin, 2009).  \nFor example, a self-regulated individual can monitor, predict, shift, and direct one\u2019s internal and \nexternal experiences, whereas co-regulation extends beyond one\u2019s inner experiences and places \ntotal experience in a broader social and historic context.   \u201cWhat have you done to improve \nyourself\u201d is different than \u201cHow have you pursued your goals given the influences of (insert \ncircumstance)?\u201d\nFor our main activity today, we are going to bump up our Mindfulness segment. \nII: Mindfulness Activity\nASE Meditation 3: \nLast week we did a brief exercise where you were encouraged to consider how any single \nexperience has diverse and complex determining factors that all contributed to the experience.  \nNothing simply happens, but events occur out of numerous and often elusive prior influences.  \nIn a similar way, you were encouraged to attend to various possibilities that might arise from \nany circumstance.  Our initial feelings can be completely valid; in fact, given the prior \ndeterminants, how we react to situations is plausible. This said, simply because something is \nplausible doesn\u2019t mean that it is inevitable.  By having a flexible perspective about prior \ncauses and diverse possibilities, we can be confronted by challenges, but also influence new \nmore desirable outcomes.  \nThis week, we are going to take this practice one step further and encourage you to consider \nhow our inner dialogues affect our inner experiences or the experiences we have with others.  \n\nReturning to the lesson last week, we started by discerning facts about experiences from our inner \nevaluation of those experiences.  That inner evaluation is baked into what it is to be a human, so \nwe cannot likely turn it completely off (nor do we want to, as it can be protective or even lead to \nevaluations of gratitude and joy); but we do want to be more intentional about how we are \naffected by our inner stories.  \nFor example, I was recently working with a teacher who was struggling with a student who was \nchallenging in class, often interrupting the lessons with out outbursts.  We can accept that these \nbehaviors are troubling, for you as teacher, for his peers in the classroom, and even for the \nstudent himself.  We can also accept that there were probably prior causes for these behaviors, \nour reactions, and the effects on the classroom.  In this case, the student was dealing with his \nparent\u2019s divorce, persistent violence in his neighborhood, among other things.  By accepting these \nas possible influences, we can respond differently to this kid.  Rather than reacting simply to the \ndisruptions in class, we might respond with empathy.  This doesn\u2019t require us to necessarily fix or \neven mention any of the causes, but by responding with compassion we might create new \noutcomes for all parties involved. \nPlease start by taking a seat and finding a comfortable and yet alert position.  The goal here is \nto be comfortable and yet alert.  \nAs you focus your gentle awareness on sitting, perhaps take a few deep breaths.  Identify \nwhere the breath enters and then settles in your body.  Continue to breathe naturally, noticing \nyour unique breathing signature; notice any sensations in your body, or maybe more salient \nare thoughts that come to mind.  Simply observe these experiences as they come and then \nnaturally fade.  It is curious that these inner experiences seem to come; note that they have an \norigin, birthed out of the sum total of your history and biology. There is nothing right or \nwrong about your experiences or history, simply note that these current sensations are present \nwith you now.  \nTake a few more seconds and merely observe experiences as they arise.  \nNow, let\u2019s shift focus and provoke a specific type of experience, all while maintaining the \nsame orientation of openness and acceptance. \nTake a moment and try and generate a memory of a recent challenging conversation. Don\u2019t \ntoggle through various memories or thoughts, simply land on the first one that comes to mind. \nContinue to breathe and use your breath as a way to accept that your experiences where valid \ngiven your history, personage, biology; also breathe with an openness that this validity doesn\u2019t \nforeclose you from different ways of experiencing yourself or others.  \nAs you continue to mind your intentional breathing, again quickly and without elaboration, \nbring the experience to mind.  Suspend the evaluations you have, but bring your awareness to \nyour PROCESS.  See yourself suspending your initial reaction.  With a deep breath, witness \nyourself observing in an instant, \u201cthis conversation has a history, it occurred this way because \nof prior causes.\u201d  Say to yourself, \u201cI am going to respond in a way that creates connection in \nthis conversation, where all participants will feel acceptance, safety, encouragement, and \n\nrespect.\u201d      \nOur default ways of communicating are not necessarily wrong or harmful.  Again, we accept \nthat they have a history.  But they do tend to be focused inward, privileging our perspective.  \nAs counterintuitive as it seems, we have a greater influence on others, in almost all \ncircumstances, when we broach interactions with acceptance, safety, encouragement, and \nrespect. \n \nThis need not take much time.  What we are doing today is pairing our breathing with this \norientation of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect.  What occurs over time is that \nwhen we focus on our intentional breathing, this orientation will more likely be generated \nwithout much effort.  \nFor approximately 20 seconds, breath and attend to your process of connecting with others.  \nTry not to blame, evaluate, or even look for causes or justifications. Simply note that there are \ncauses and accept them.  Then shift this acceptance to an orientation preoccupied with \nacceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect for self and others. \n15 seconds\nIn accepting our thoughts and feelings, we are not passively accepting harmful things that \nhappen to us.  In a similar way, we don\u2019t accept that only helpful things will occur all of the \ntime.  Instead, we accept that our experiences are legitimate but the practice of breathing and \nreflection might contribute to more intentional, curious, flexible, and socially helpful \noutcomes. And when it doesn\u2019t immediately contribute, it makes us more likely to try \nsomething different until we do. Don\u2019t doubt one\u2019s ability, try another strategy. \nContinue to breathe in a normal and comfortable manner and notice any thoughts, feelings, or \nsensations that might arise.  \nWhen thoughts or feelings creep in, simply acknowledge them with brief momentary curiosity \nand then return to the breath.  \nWhen comfortable, comfortably expand your awareness back to the surroundings.  To the \ncounselor you are working with and the room that surrounds you.  \nThis week you will find yourself back in your familiar classroom.  While it might be infeasible \nto dedicate 5 to 10 minutes to capture your breath and interrogate every experience as we just \ndid together, but commit to something that is more feasible.  Is 15 seconds worth a different \noutcome?  5 seconds to breathe, 5 seconds to reflect on possible prior influences, and 5 \nseconds to consider how curious, flexible, and connected outcomes might manifest from your \ninvestment.\nThank you again for your practice and for all of the important work that you do as an educator.  \nWe are completely aware that these mere activities cannot supersede the incredible number of \nstressors you have as a teacher.  We also acknowledge that many of the tribulations we \n\nexperience are influenced primarily by others.  The point of these exercises is not to be \ncompliant but instead to make oneself more aware, accepting, and intentional in how we \nrespond to an ever-challenging world.     \n(Spend five minutes using their specific stories and asking them to practice co-regulated \nlanguage.  Use the example to help them reframe the language [i.e., \u201cWhat have you done to \nimprove yourself\u201d is different than \u201cHow have you pursued your goals given the influences of \n(insert circumstance)?\u201d]).\nEncourage the teachers to strategize how co-regulated language might affect their inner \nexperiences?  In a similar way, encourage them to ponder how it might affect others (e.g., \nstudents, colleagues).  \nII: School Environment Advocacy\nLast week we spoke about a possible event or phenomenon that is present in the school \nenvironment or culture; something that as a team we might be able to influence.  Let\u2019s take a few \nminutes to discuss some possibilities and using our concept of radical curiosity, and the skills of \nreflection and questions, what is some specific behaviors that we can do to start the process of \nclimate change in the school?  \nIV: Closing\nAs we close, I want to encourage you to think about one thing that stood out and affected you \ntoday in our session.  Commit to one very specific behavior that you can use this strategy \nimmediately.  How will you know when to use this strategy, how will you know if it was helpful, \nand if helpful how will you reinforce and celebrate your commitment or if it didn\u2019t help how can \nyou try a different strategy?  \nThank you again for your dedication. We have a spring break approaching.  I wonder if there is \none thing that each of you can dedicate specific practice, starting immediately, and reoccurring \neach day, just one thing be it the practice of radical curiosity or co-regulated language, how \nmight you practice this and how will you recognize if it is affecting you?  \nSee you when you get back. \n\nSession Four\nSchool Counselor\nWelcome back.  We have returned from a break and as we begin, I wonder if there are any \nexperiences or insights that occurred over break that you might want to be included as content \nfor our time together today?    \nTeachers\nAllow 1 minute\nSchool Counselor:\nSimilar to each of the previous weeks, I would like for each of us to begin this meeting with a \nbrief breathing exercise intended to focus our attention here together.  With this in mind, I \nencourage you to close your eyes and simply bring your awareness to your breath.  Make no \neffort to change your natural breathing at this point, simply notice that you are breathing.  Notice \nthat this breath sustains your life and is something shared between you and the world around \nyou.  Try not and judge the quality of your breath, again simply experience it for the next 10 or \nso seconds. \n(provide the teachers about 10 seconds) \nI: Teacher Self-Advocacy\nBefore break, we talked about how many of our experiences are co-determined by a number of \ninternal and external forces.  How we respond to these experiences is how we co-regulate; that is, \nhow we draw from these myriad internal and external resources and make the decisions in an \nintentional manner. \nThis week, we are going to extend this a bit by introducing the concept of connectedness.  In \nsome ways, we are all connected to these co-determinants of experience.  For example, this \nparticular consultation experience that we are sharing now is affecting you and me in ways that \nwould not have occurred had we chosen to be in a different setting.  But connectedness goes a bit \nfurther than co-determination; just as co-regulation is our efforts to act intentionally in concert \nwith our personal and social influences, connectedness is how we experience and pursue \nacceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect between ourselves and others.   \nLet\u2019s take about five minutes and explore each of these constituent parts of feeling connected. \n1) In what ways do you feel accepted or encouraged in your role as a teacher?  Are there \nways that your acceptance is compromised?  Please consider specific examples. \n2) In what ways to I consistently make others feel accepted or encouraged, including \ncolleague teachers, students, and others?  \n3) What things contributes or compromises your current school environment in the areas \nof safety and shared respect?  \nThe scholarship pertaining to feelings of connectedness in school are pretty compelling, as such \nfeelings are associated with teacher stress, burnout, and persistence; for students, connectedness \nis affiliated with achievement, school behavior, and mental wellness.  While we cannot control \n\nothers feelings of connectedness, in the spirit of co-determination of experience, the literature is \nalso clear that our feelings of connectedness can affect others.  With this in mind, I wonder if we \ncan come up with a simple, valuable (to you) goal to amplify the feelings of connectedness in \nyour classroom?  \n(one minute)\nII: School Environment Advocacy\nOver the past few weeks we have talked about ideas to improve the school climate; particularly \nthings that I might be able to do or advocate for as a school counselor, working in tandem with \nyou as teachers.  Inspired by your goals for highlighting connectedness in your classrooms, what \nfurther things might be improved upon in the broader school or education climate to affect your \nexperiences of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect?  What is one possible thing that \nwe could do immediately to affect you and how you operate in the system? \nIII: Mindfulness Activity\nI want us to take about 10 minutes and participate in our fourth formal mindfulness exercise.  I \nwill read the script and participate in any way that feels comfortable and relevant.   \nASE Meditation 4\nWelcome back.  Like you, the teachers and counselors involved in this project, I am coming \nback from spring break.  I love these two words combined.  Spring suggests new life.  It also \nreminds me of a spring that coils into tension and then releases, jumping forward as if \npursuing some intentional goal with passion.  Break reminds us of the importance of resting \nand resetting, particularly after springing forward towards any goal.  This message of \nspringing towards goals and taking the time to break is an important lesson for us educators. \nIn our last mindfulness activity, we performed an exercise on attending to our thoughts, \nbracketing out any evaluations that get smuggled into our internal narratives, and pursuing \nmore personally and socially meaningful outcomes.  \nThis week we are going to pivot from introspection to how we interface with others.  We \ncannot control other people, nor do we really want to (although it would occasionally be \nconvenient or helpful!!!).  But we do want to be intentional in how we affect them, as our \nintentions are likely to have some influence, which in turn will affect how they interface with \nus and further affect our inner experiences.  In this way, our experiences are both connected \nand yet somewhat controllable.  \nPlease start by taking a seat and finding a comfortable and yet alert position.  The goal here is \nto be comfortable and yet alert.  \nAs you focus your gentle awareness on sitting, perhaps take a few deep breaths.  Identify \nwhere the breath enters and then settles in your body.  Continue to breathe naturally, noticing \nyour unique breathing signature; notice any sensations in your body, or maybe more salient \n\nare thoughts that come to mind.  Simply observe these experiences as they come and then \nnaturally fade.  It is curious that these inner experiences seem to come; note that they have an \norigin, birthed out of the sum total of your history and biology. There is nothing right or \nwrong about your experiences or history, simply note that these current sensations are present \nwith you now.  \nTake a few more seconds and merely observe experiences as they arise.  \nNow, let\u2019s shift focus and provoke a specific type of experience, all while maintaining the \nsame orientation of openness and acceptance. \nTake a moment and try to bring to your awareness a person in the school environment who \nmakes you feel accepted, safe, encouraged, and respected.  This person could be a colleague or \neven a student, but someone who you feel unreserved reverence for\u2026 now imagine that this \nperson can somehow intuitively experience your current esteem and I want you to witness how \nit affects them.  Witness the joy and appreciation in their response to your impressions about \nthem.   \n15 seconds\nStanding beside this person who you have identified and honored, conjure up the image of \nanother person, someone in school who doesn\u2019t know their worth but you see their brilliance \nand importance.  Using the same power of intuition, this person can also somehow experience \nall of the hope, compassion, and support you now experience on their behalf.  Take just a few \nmoments to observe how their prior manner changed as a consequence of your feelings \ntowards them.  \n15 seconds\nFinally, standing besides these two featured people, now bring to mind someone in school who \nchallenges or even frustrates you.  Continue to breathe in a normal and comfortable manner \nand notice any thoughts, feelings, or sensations that might arise.  When thoughts or feelings \ncreep in, simply acknowledge them with brief momentary curiosity and then return to the \nbreath.  Try not to couple your prior evaluation of this person with your current experience, \nsimply note the prior history of challenge and return to your breath and open awareness.  (10 \nseconds) Now, look at all three people standing in a line in your mind; use the successes you \ninvested in the initial two individuals and offer the same support and compassion to this third \nperson.  (ten seconds) Notice if there is any changes in how you experience this person when \nyou think of them with unmitigated compassion. \nTake about one minute and see yourself standing in front of all three individuals, imagine \nyourself investing connectedness and compassion to each of these people for the entire \nduration.  \nTake just a moment and reflect on how this mental exercise affected your perspective.  Take \none final moment to extend this same compassion and connection to all beings in the school or \n\npeople who affect people in your school.  \nWhen comfortable, comfortably expand your awareness back to the surroundings.  To the \ncounselor you are working with and the room that surrounds you.  \nThis week you will find yourself back in your familiar classroom.  While it might be infeasible \nto dedicate 5 to 10 minutes to capture your breath and interrogate every experience as we just \ndid together, but commit to something that is more feasible.  Is 15 seconds worth a different \noutcome?  5 seconds to breathe, 5 seconds to reflect on possible prior influences, and 5 \nseconds to consider how curious, flexible, and connected outcomes might manifest from your \ninvestment.\nThank you again for your practice and for all of the important work that you do as an educator.  \nWe are completely aware that these mere activities cannot supersede the incredible number of \nstressors you have as a teacher.  We also acknowledge that many of the tribulations we \nexperience are influenced primarily by others.  The point of these exercises is not to be \ncompliant but instead to make oneself more aware, accepting, and intentional in how we \nrespond to an ever-challenging world.     \nIV: Closing\nReturn back to the group when comfortable.  As we close, I want to encourage you to think about \none thing that stood out and affected you today in our session.  Commit to one very specific \nbehavior that you can use this strategy immediately.  How will you know when to use this \nstrategy, how will you know if it was helpful, and if helpful how will you reinforce and celebrate \nyour commitment or if it didn\u2019t help how can you try a different strategy?  \n\nSession Five\nSchool Counselor\nWelcome back.  We have made it to week five of this project!!! Congratulations.  I genuinely \nhope that this has been as valuable to you as it has been for us as counselors.  I have learned a lot \nand I hope that the experiences here in some way can translate into the total school environment.  \nWith that in mind, as we get started, I hope to use this last meeting as an opportunity to reflect on \nany developments, continued areas for personal and school growth, and looking forward to \nspecific goals and resources.  \nSchool Counselor:\nAs we have done in each of the previous weeks, I would like for each of us to begin this meeting \nwith a brief breathing exercise intended to focus our attention here together.  With this in mind, I \nencourage you to close your eyes and simply bring your awareness to your breath.  Make no \neffort to change your natural breathing at this point, simply notice that you are breathing.  Notice \nthat this breath sustains your life and is something shared between you and the world around \nyou.  Try not and judge the quality of your breath, again simply experience it for the next 10 or \nso seconds. \n(provide the teachers about 10 seconds) \nI: Teacher Self-Advocacy\nThroughout the previous four weeks, we have talked about a number of topics, some based on \nyour experiences as educators and others include some things that we have introduced from the \nempirical literature.  Major themes include consider prior determinants of your experiences as \nteachers and even what contributes to the experiences of others. We have discussed and practices \nways to co-regulate our responses to experience.  For this week, it might be helpful to allow you \nto list some of the things that you have found helpful or some of the things that you are still \nworking on.  \n(using ASE-inspired active listening and reflecting skills, engage in approximately 5 minutes, \nincluding validating, expanding, and creating concrete plans for how to continue to grow)\nWhat topics were helpful?  In what ways did these topics specifically affect you personally or \nyour classrooms?  \nWere there any specific behaviors that were inspired by your experiences here in this project?  In \nwhat ways might these behaviors be something you can retain and even amplify for the \nremainder of the academic year? \nIt is helpful for many people to celebrate our successes, even if they appear small and \ninsignificant they can have a profound and exponential effect on systems.  Consider the phrase, \n\u201cLittle by little, bit by bit, I am improving every day.\u201d  Small insights or large revelations here \n(or elsewhere) don\u2019t just affect one experience or relationship, but have the potential to be \ngeneralized broadly in one\u2019 personal and professional life. \n\nAlso considering the incremental nature of growth, we can become aware of the importance of \ncompassion for self and others.  Compassion is the steady and composed concern with either \npersistent or circumstantial feelings of suffering; com  as a prefix means \u201cto be with\u201d and passion \nas the anchors highlights the \u201cstrong emotional connection.\u201d  Being a teacher is sometimes \nchallenging.  We are deeply connected to it, because we value the content areas where learning \noccurs and we value students as learners.  Sometimes, we are so tied to the outcome of learning \nthat the passion exceeds the being-with requirement.  Let\u2019s take a few moments today and work \nthrough how we can act compassionately with ourselves and others.  What are some specific \nchallenges that are still present in our school or your specific classroom?  How can you reframe \nthe challenge as a passion?  And, what specific behaviors would accomplish \u201cbeing with?\u201d\nII: School Environment Advocacy\nOver the past few weeks we have talked about ideas to improve the school climate; particularly \nthings that I might be able to do or advocate for as a school counselor, working in tandem with \nyou as teachers.  Inspired by your goals for highlighting connectedness in your classrooms, what \nfurther things might be improved upon in the broader school or education climate to affect your \nexperiences of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect?  What is one possible thing that \nwe could do immediately to affect you and how you operate in the system? \nIII: Mindfulness Activity  \nASE Meditation 5: \nThank you for making it this far!!! When you committed to this project, you had only a modest \nnotion of what would occur and yet here we are!!! Hopefully from those modest beginnings you \nhave found one or more things helpful. \nAs humans, we generally crave seeing things to resolution. Like the storybooks from our youth, if \nthere was a beginning there certainly must be an ending.  As adults, life doesn\u2019t always feel so \nsequential; even with the various habits we maintain, the arch of time appears to march onward.  \nIf true, absolute resolution seems elusive.  In its absence, to persist, we must accomplish some \ntype of compassion for self and the other peoples in our lives.  Compassion is the steady and \ncomposed concern with either persistent or circumstantial feelings of suffering; this is \ncaptured in the word construction itself; the prefix com refers to \u201cbeing with\u201d and passion is \nany \u201cstrong emotional connection\u201d to someone or thing.  \nThis week we will focus on the practice of compassion.  If experiences are predicated by prior \ndeterminants, no one can be fully responsible and yet because we are passionate about our \nexperiences, we are responsible to have the greatest influence on the outcomes.   \nAs you focus your gentle awareness on sitting, perhaps take a few deep breaths.  Identify \nwhere the breath enters and then settles in your body.  Continue to breathe naturally, noticing \nyour unique breathing signature; notice any sensations in your body, or maybe more salient \nare thoughts that come to mind.  Simply observe these experiences as they come and then \n\nnaturally fade.  It is curious that these inner experiences seem to come; note that they have an \norigin, birthed out of the sum total of your history and biology. There is nothing right or \nwrong about your experiences or history, simply note that these current sensations are present \nwith you now.  \nTake a few more seconds and merely observe experiences as they arise.  \nNow, let\u2019s shift focus and provoke a specific type of experience, all while maintaining the \nsame orientation of openness and acceptance. \nWith each in-breath, say to yourself, as if rehearsing for the great play that is one\u2019s own life, \n\u201cbe with\u201d and then with the deep and yet comfortable out-breadth, \u201cgive out.\u201d  Be with.  Give \nout.  \n(30 seconds)\nThis mental rehearsal coupled with the breathing is intended to codify the experience of \npatience and curiosity that you might associate with these exercises with the intentions to be \ntruly and deeply with yourself and others, and then the intention to give out compassion to \nyourself in others as co-determinants of experience.  Continue to breathe; be with, give out. \n(15 seconds)\nThis action of breathing reflects the words themselves and illustrates how we are affected by \nothers and how we affect others.  This logical concludes the importance of compassion.  If our \naspiration is to live a quality life, we must be with and give out to self and others.  We breath \nin what all people and non-people in the world give us, and we give out through breathing.  \nJust like our minds, what we bring in and what we give out affects the qualities of experience.  \n(15 seconds)\nTake about one minute and see yourself standing in front of all three individuals, imagine \nyourself investing connectedness and compassion to each of these people for the entire \nduration.  \nThank you for your commitment to these practices for the last month and a half.  We \ngenuinely hope that you found some value.  Certainly, exploring how your mind works in \nthese brief exercises is insufficient given the fast pace and complexity of our lives, but \nhopefully these mere activities offered some examples of what is possible when you are \ncurious (about self and others), co-regulate, connect, and act with compassion.  Further, we \nhope that these exercises inspire you to find other related support, as your work as a teacher is \ninvaluable and you genuinely deserve these types of support. \nIV: Closing\n\nThese five weeks have been inspiring and enlightening.   As we close, I want to encourage you to \nthink about one thing that stood out and affected you today in our session.  Commit to one very \nspecific behavior that you can use this strategy immediately.  How will you know when to use \nthis strategy, how will you know if it was helpful, and if helpful how will you reinforce and \ncelebrate your commitment or if it didn\u2019t help how can you try a different strategy?  \nOne thing is not trivial.  Thank you again for all that you do.    \n\nReferences \nAnderson, H. (2015). Postmodern/poststructural/social construction therapies: Collaborative, \nnarrative, and solution-focused. In T.

Lemberger-Truelove\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8916-9678\n\nChapter 4 Abstract\nInterventions informed by the Advocating Student-with-Environment (ASE) theory for school \ncounseling are intended to support student\u2019s individual capacities while also simultaneously \npursuing more just and facilitative school circumstances.  In this chapter, the author introduces a \nvariety of example practice behaviors that school counselors can adopt when inspired by the \nASE approach.  Each of these practice behaviors are affiliated with the \u201c5 Cs of ASE theory\u201d \nwhich are curiosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution.  \n\nAlthough each person is always a student, there is a special signature to the experience of \nbeing a student in a formal school environment.  The broad intention of a school is to provide \nvarious conditions for each student to develop in personally and socially useful ways.  \nUnfortunately, not all schooling conditions are supportive and, instead, students are often \nconfronted by deleterious conditions.  Both helpful and injurious experiences in schools result in \nlearning.  In turn, learning opportunities are internalized and shared back into the school and \nsocietal environments.  \nFor school counselors, the inevitability and complexity of learning require intervention \nfoci that are both compliant and additive.  Interventions are compliant when they are germane to \nthe cultural, environmental, and circumstantial condition of the student.  Almost paradoxically, \ninterventions must consistently apprehend these relevancies while also stretching the student in \nnovel ways.  Lev Vygotsky alluded to this when he posited the zone of proximal development \nmore than a century ago; that is, learning occurs in that space between the prior unmediated \ncapacities of the learner and the introduction to experiences that encourage new vistas of \ndevelopment (Zaretiski, 2009).    \nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) is a school counseling-specific theory \nintended to describe students as learners, schools as systems, and how school counselors can best \nsupport the development of all participants in educational systems as interacting determinants of \nexperience (Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014; Lemberger-Truelove & Bowers, \n2019).  Utilizing manualized protocols, advocacy activities pointed at various social ecosystems, \nand spontaneous counseling dialogue and behaviors, ASE-informed school counselors intervene \nboth with students and adult stakeholders in corresponding ways such that individual capacities \nripen into co-regulatory experiences and outcomes. \n\nAs mentioned in previous chapters, ASE is not necessarily a collection of counseling \ntechniques; rather, it is a theoretical overlay that can be applied to almost any classic or emergent \nschool counseling practice.  Specifically, ASE is a steadfast concern with how personal and \nsocial capacities can be cultivated in ways that result in improved outcomes for students and \nothers in the school environment as interacting determinants of experience.  This conceptual \nfocus suggests that school counseling interventions must be relevant to the student and school \ncontext alike, which can be challenging given that these entities might not always exist in concert \nwith the other.   \nIt is assumed that interventions inspired by ASE can have multiple outcomes for the \nstudent and the school system given the focus pertains to amplifying the prior conditions of \nexperience, as opposed to the pursuit of fixed or even specific goals.  Certainly, specific \noutcomes can be accomplished using ASE, but given the labyrinthine nature of systems in \nschools and the complexity of the system as a person within various systems of influence, it is \nmore prudent for school counseling to aim at general and flexible capacities rather than distinct \nresults.  This position is liberating in various ways, as it suggests that it is the student\u2019s capacity \nto develop and that such development can continue to evolve in helpful ways beyond the \nintervention.  In this way, the ASE school counselor is not the sole arbitrator of the intervention \nor the outcome but another additive determinant of experience with the student and school \nenvironment.  \nThe Structures of ASE Interventions\nMore than two decades before this current chapter was written, I (Matthew) found myself \nas a school counseling practicum student in a high school.  I was assigned to work with a \nfreshman who was experiencing a variety of academic struggles.  Many of the ideas found in \n\nASE today were percolating in my mind, and yet I wasn\u2019t always the most consistent practitioner \nin implementing the acme of ASE with students.  Nonetheless, this early professional experience \nwas a watershed moment and became an important influence on the structure of ASE related \ninterventions.  \nThe student described constant anxiety as he neared a state-mandated academic test.  At \nthe time in Florida, passing each section of these high-stakes tests was necessary to move on to \nthe next academic grade.  My intention was to introduce relevant and accessible strategies for \nlearning.  We practiced several strategies, but he was particularly drawn to mnemonics (i.e., \nprompts that aid in information retention and memory retrieval).  I knew that working memory is \na critical to learning and an executive functioning skill associated with various desirable personal \nand learning outcomes for children and adolescents (Otero et al., 2014).  \nHe left an individual meeting one afternoon particularly excited about a mnemonic \nstrategy we practiced.  I recall vividly how he expressed his excitement to use it in his next class.  \nTo my dismay, he didn\u2019t return to see me the next week as he had customarily done for more \nthan a month prior.  I then saw him as he was finishing his lunch and I asked him how he had \nbeen and briefly asked about his progress with the mnemonics.  His response was chilling.  He \nsaid, \u201cYou know.  It didn\u2019t work.  I sat in class waiting to use it.  The teacher just never did \nanything in class where I could use it.  I decided not to come back to counseling with you.  \nSchool is already hard enough for me. Why should I learn new things with you if they don\u2019t help \nme?  Other kids don\u2019t need to learn these things.  They just get it.  I don\u2019t get it if I try new \nthings or if I do the same old thing, so why try something new?\u201d \nI found myself genuinely impressed with his logic.  I was also disappointed that this was \nhis experience.  As he walked away to his next class, my thoughts then pivoted to his teacher, \n\n\u201cWhat must she be thinking?  She let him out of class and there were no observable differences.  \nMaybe the only observable difference was that her distressed student is further dispirited.\u201d  \nIt then hit me.  There were probably no less than ten or more times that the teacher said or \ndid something in class when the student could have used a mnemonic or one of the other skills \nwe worked on in our times together.  Further, the teacher could have made these opportunities \nmore explicit had she known how to specifically prompt and reinforce one of the student\u2019s \nstrategies.  At this moment, it was clear that the student and teacher were co-determinants of \nexperience and related outcomes.  It was clear to me the importance of reflexive interventions.    \nReflexive interventions occur when the school counselor connects the capacities of the \nstudent with the conditions of the school environment.  The acme reflexive intervention occurs \nwhen the school counselor connects with the student in such a way that the intervention helps \ncultivate one or more capacities in the student, and those capacities are further connected to the \nbehaviors and conditions in the school.  For example, a school counselor can work with a student \non the executive function of emotional regulation (Zelazo & Cunningham, 2007).  While \nprotecting the privacy of the specific student, the school counselor can then work with that \nstudent\u2019s classroom teacher to fortify emotional regulation.  In this manner, the intervention \noperates with the student and teacher (as a representative of the school environment) as a co-\ndetermining system, as different than a deficit to be remedied in either the student or teacher \ndiscretely.  \nAlthough school counselors who adopt the ASE approach are encouraged to deliver \nreflexive interventions targeted at both students and people in their various systems (often \nteachers or other influential adults), it is feasible to work directly with one entity and assume that \nsuch efforts will affect other players in the system.  For example, one of my early experiences as \n\na first-year professional school counselor occurred between a student who came to see me \nwanting to change math teachers.  After a few minutes of conversation, it was evident that her \nconcern with this teacher reflected relational dynamics with older female authorities (especially \nthose who resembled her grandmother, who was her caregiver).  While her veteran teacher was \nunwilling to consult with me, the student and I worked on approaches to regulate her reactivity to \nthe teacher and remain engaged in the instruction.  The focus of the work was the student-within-\nenvironment, which in turn affected her performance in the class and subsequently affected her \nrelationship with her grandmother.  \nThe reality for many school counselors is that they are outpaced by the critical needs in \nschools, with student caseloads that often exceed recommendations and empirical evidence \n(ASCA, 2019; Woods & Domina, 2014) and outstanding student learning and mental health \nneeds (DeKruyf et al., 2013).  The demanding nature of reflexive interventions might seem \ninfeasible, yet, the generative manner that such approaches can affect total systems might merit \ninvestment and sacrifice.  \nAdditionally, school counselors might incur resistance, especially from school personnel \nwho are also overwhelmed with responsibilities and who are often given messages that they are \nsingularly responsible for the conditions of education.  For example, one type of reflexive \nintervention endorsed by ASE theory is when a school counselor performs one or more \nclassroom guidance activities (i.e., psychoeducational and counseling approaches targeting entire \nclasses of students and their teacher[s]) where the teacher actively engages in the in-class \nexperience and often further participates in consultation with the school counselor before or after \nthe in-class activities.  The intention is varied, including generating investment in the teacher and \npriming skills exposed to students to the teacher (to be used in subsequent classroom \n\nexperiences).  There have been several ASE empirical studies that substantiate the value of these \nreflexive interventions (e.g., Bowers et al., 2020; Lemberger et al., 2018(b); Molina et al., 2022), \nyet the duration and commitment can be daunting.  Alternatively, persisting without substantive \nchange can be even more daunting; as such, the school counselor can advocate the potential for \nchange that is mutually gratifying to students and educators over longer periods of time and with \nmyriad desirable outcomes.  In fact, qualitative studies of ASE interventions have yielded \nsurprising and unintended outcomes for teachers, where the benefits were not only felt in their \nclassrooms and with students but also in their personal lives beyond the school environment \n(Molina et al., under review). \nAnticipated Student and School Environment Outcomes\nForemost, ASE is a social justice approach to school counseling in the tradition of the \nvarious liberation psychologies (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2016).  In this manner, social change occurs \nthrough empowering various individuals within systems.  The individual (student) is not \nunderstood as an automaton but rather as a co-determinant of personal and social experiences.  \nIt feels like we\u2019re making contemporaneous decisions, but mental and physical actions \nare bound up in prior personal and social determinants.  Our intuitions suggest a type of \nteleology where purposeful effort drives experience (rather than prior material causes), whereas \nASE theory is more in line with teleonomy (Pittendrigh, 1958), which retains a goal-oriented \ndenouement but concedes that natural and social forces mediate and shape outcomes for people \nand events.  This posture suggests that the student emerges out of prior influences, yet the \nstudent still does have some volitional influence over one\u2019s experience within the environment.  \nChange leading to new outcomes are embodied as experience.  Stated simply, the orientation of \n\nthe student can be cultivated, and reflexively the school environment can be altered, how each \ninteraction affects the ensuing experience of the other.  \nWhen a student experiences new insight (learning) or new social conditions, it appears \nlike change manifests because of personal insight.  This is a dualistic way of thinking about \nstudent development that does not cohere with ASE.  Instead, insight is experiential within a \nsocial context and thus embodied with a varying magnitude of influence.  The experience of \nchange occurs as an observation of embodiment, which in turn affects contemporary experience \nand the trajectory of future learning.  Change for the student (and school environment) is the \nobservation of the experienced cultivation of self (student) and reflexive observations of change \nin the school environment.  School counseling, therefore, is the creation of the personal and \nsocial experiences that contribute to this appearance of change, which in turn affect the actual \nexperience of the student and school.\nSchool counseling intervention is thus a persistent process of priming.  When working \nwith the individual student, the school counselor does not pursue specific desirable schooling \noutcomes.  This is an alluring approach to school counseling practice, but it is infeasible, \nunsustainable, and disarming to the student.  A specific outcome, like finding a specific solution \nto disagreements amongst peers, suggests that the past will replicate the future with perfect \nprecision.  Instead, it is more prudent to draw from past experiences and collaborate with the \nstudent so that that student can anticipate and respond with flexibility and adroitness.  \nCorrespondingly, the school counselor is in a persistent process of priming the relevant features \nfound in the school environment.  Are there conditions in the family or classroom context that \ncontribute to peer conflict?  Priming the student and school environment contributes to simpatico \n\noutcomes, even given the profound complexity of systems and the evolution that occurs across \ntime in schools.  \nIn some of the original ASE writings (Lemberger, 2010), the term student sapience was \nused to describe a deep wisdom in the design and operation of experience (Trowbridge, 2011).  \nIn the tradition of philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza (1677) and Metzinger (2004), sapience \ndoes not operate as a mental phenomenon outside of one\u2019s body or circumstance in the world; \nrather, it is an integrated and experiential way of being.  This is to say, a student does not have to \nunderstand the total composition of experience or all consequences, but only that some \nintentional contribution to self and the environment affects outcomes.  \nThis distinction is important for the psychological and social development of students.  A \nschool counselor does not necessarily anticipate that a kindergartener will be fully aware of the \ninfluences of poverty on their plight as a student, but a classroom activity on how to balance \nhealthy sleep habits in challenging environments might help avert some biological delimiters and \ncontribute to better schooling outcomes (Hayes & Bainton, 2020).  The technical insights about \nsleep biology are less important than the experiential perspective.      \nIn practice, the outcome of student sapience reflects the emerging term allostasis, that is, \nhow the student accomplishes efficient regulation of needs and capacities prior to incidents when \nthose needs and capacities are required for survival or thriving (Sterling, 2012).  Regulation of \nthe self is not to be confused with accomplishing some hypothetical homeostatic state, rather, it \nis a perpetual predictive pursuant of outcomes (Schulkin et al., 1994).  School counselors \nconnect with students in a manner that encourages the cultivation of capacities that are usable in \nvarious ways.  There is some evidence in support of these claims in the empirical literature in \nsupport of ASE.  For example, Lemberger and colleagues trained school counselors to deliver \n\npsychoeducational content to entire classrooms of students and teachers and found that the \nintervention that focused on social and cognitive skills contributed to social and emotional \nlearning outcomes in addition to improvements in academic achievement tests (Lemberger-\nTruelove et al., 2018).  The content of the psychoeducational activities was not explicitly \nacademic in nature, and yet changes in personal and social development cohered with math and \nreading achievement.  \nOutcomes at the student level are primary, although the student is never understood as the \nsingle or even primary cause of experience or the school environment.  The student in the center \nof change ensures that advocacy on behalf of the student is always relevant to the emerging \ncapacities and values of the student, not the school system or even well-intended school \ncounselor as arbitrators.  Just as students are understood as co-determinants of change, agents in \nschools are expected to ameliorate outcomes.  So not to compromise the student as primary, \npursuing more just and contributory outcomes at the school level must cohere with the \nimmediate experience of the student.  \nIn practice, accompanying any anticipated outcomes in students, the school counselor \nmust advocate for changes at the school level.  Outcomes can vary based on the recipient or \ncircumstance.  For example, in some cases, merely providing empirical insights into how ethnic \ndiscrimination affects academic outcomes and disciplinary practices can result in radical new \nperspectives.  More invasive interventions might require the school counselor to work \nextensively with educators or policymakers to challenge implicit biases pertaining to groups of \nstudents.  \nThe highest aspiration of ASE is manifest in co-regulated contribution shared amongst as \nmany relevant players in the school environment, including but not limited to the student.  \n\nContribution (as one of the 5Cs of ASE theory) is an outcome and a practice where the schooling \nprocess includes tangible activities of personal and social liberation.  For example, students who \nwere formerly participants in a grief group might later serve as support agents for students in \nsubsequent years.  Teachers who engage in consultation with school counselors might be \nrecruited to advocate for gender and identity equality policies at the district level.  \nASE Counseling and Advocacy Relationships\nAcross all forms of counseling, scholars have found that a quality relationship shared \nbetween counselor and client is predictive of desirable outcomes (Wampold & Budge, 2012).  \nMany clinicians misconstrue these findings in some pollyannish manner.  Instead, adherents to \nthe ASE approach conceptualize healing relationships in a very specific manner.  When \ninteracting with any agent in a school, the school counselor approaches each new moment with a \nradical curiosity that is mediated by a sense of connectedness and compassion and aimed at \npersonal and social contribution.  \nFigure 1\nAdvocating Student-within-Environment Relational Map\nStudent\n      within\nEducators & policy makers, \nEnvironment\nguardians & family \nmembers,\nsocial & cultural systems\nCuriosity \nCo-regulation\n(endogenous)\nCuriosity \nConnectedness\nConnectedness\nCompassion\nCompassion\n               Contribution \n                (allostasis)\nAt the core, there is an uncompromising belief in the potential of the student (and school \nenvironment) for growth (Yeager & Dweck, 2020).  This recognition that changes and \ndevelopment are inevitable is not confused with asserting or pushing a top-down outcome for the \n\nstudent (or school); instead, this is a steadfast commitment by the school counselor to share in \nthe unique circumstance of the student and their environment.     \nThe exemplar ASE informed relationship is endogenous.  Endogenous is defined as \n\u201cwithin\u201d or \u201cincreasing by internal growth,\u201d which reflects the word \u201cwithin\u201d in Advocating \nStudent-within-Environment.  The counselor strives to experience within the student\u2019s \nperspective and context.  The K12 student, as a child and adolescent, is emerging from the \nvarious influences of one\u2019s biology, one\u2019s experience, and one\u2019s positionality in the various \nenvironments that one inhabits.  Similarly, the counselor operates within the various social \ncontexts that constitute or influences the school environment.  With both the student and features \nof the school environment, the within posture is not stagnant; rather, it is assumed that \ndevelopment emerges when the school counselor engages the student (or school) with curiosity, \nconnectedness, and compassion, that is, in turn, co-regulated in the school environment and \nmight lead to mutual contribution. \nThere is a double-sidedness to an endogenous orientation as a school counselor.  Within \nsuggests a sincere commitment to the student or school as each is and yet further suggests that \nwithin both the student and school are more capacities and possibilities than are often known or \nexpressed.  For example, the practice of cultural broaching (Day-Vines et al., 2021), which is \nwhen the counselor engages in a direct and respectful conversation about the client\u2019s various \nintersecting identity positions, from an ASE perspective is both prizing the student\u2019s cultural \ninfluences and yet pushing for the most facilitative version of those cultural forces.  In this \nmanner, each interchange prizes the determinants of experience, present perceptions and \npredilections, and future possibilities.   \n\nVygotsky (1978) wisely offered, \u201cthe method is simultaneously prerequisite and product, \nthe tool and the result of the study\u201d (p.65).  The endogenous (within) relationship is what the \nschool counselor presents but also the anticipated outcomes for the student and school \nenvironment.  The school counselor utilizes curiosity which will stoke curiosity in the student, \nwhich will, in turn, serve the student and school environment in ways that extend beyond the \ninitial counseling relationship.  In similar ways, the school counselor will embody connectedness \nand compassion, and the mere experience will prime these generative capacities in students.  \nHow these various capacities expressed will be unique to each student, as the counselor holds no \npreconceived notion or expectation of their manifestation.  \nThe counseling literature has matured over the decades, with an advancing concern with \nissues of diversity, equity, and inclusion.  These are important for the various mental health \nprofessions including school counseling and foundational for ASE theory.  This said, the \npreponderance of the diversity, equity, and inclusion literature often discusses counselor values \nand less often articulates the praxis necessary to produce such laudable ends.  ASE takes a hard \nstand on how a school counselor can pursue justice in and beyond school systems.  Sustainable \nchange comes from within co-regulating individuals and systems.  The school counselor is both \nwithin the school system and yet something different as a student advocate.  Therefore, the \nschool counselor can identify the mechanisms to change the system while recruiting the student \nto be a self-advocate of change that is, therefore, more likely to be relevant and persistent.  \nFrom an ASE perspective, the school counselor always intervenes with relevance to the \nstudent and the school environment as co-determinants of desired outcomes.  What dictates the \nintervention focus are the assessed needs and the anticipated magnitude of effect.  There are \noccasions when the structural issues in the school are so profound that it is most reasonable to \n\ninitiate intervention at the school level.  The school counselor remains steadfast to the needs and \ncapacities of the student, and yet the greatest change for that student most likely will result from \nsupport provided at the school system level.  For example, if a teacher is experiencing \ndebilitating stress that is affecting classroom pedagogy, the school counselor certainly works \nwith the teacher but does so insofar as the efforts towards stress reduction contributes to \nclassroom climate and student support.  Alternatively, the school counselor might choose to \nintervene directly with one or a group of students based on personal or social struggles.  In \nfocusing on the individual student\u2019s need, the ASE-informed school counselor intervenes with \nenvironmental resources and the context in mind.  \nRegardless of the intervention focus, the development of the student-within-environment \nis the Archimedean point for the school counselor.  Social systems greatly influence the \nexperience of the student, and yet the persistence of relevant systemic change is catalyzed in the \nindividual student.  In the spirit of liberation approaches to social justice, the ASE-informed \nschool counselor conceives of the K12 student as newly emerging and therefore has the greatest \ntime and influence on the future permutations of the social environments.  \nPersonal liberation and social justice are baked into ASE. There is an oscillation between \npractice activities directed at the student or at the various constituent aspects of the school \nenvironment, with the ideal interventions simultaneously engaging as many individual \nparticipants as possible in the school environment.  This position does not suggest that students \nare solely responsible for confronting discriminatory, oppressive, or generally unhelpful forces in \nschools but it does propound that student engagement is necessary for any systems change to be \nrelevant, sustainable, and adaptive as threatening personal and social forces evolve over time and \nacross circumstances.  \n\nASE Informed School Counseling Behaviors\nAs stated, ASE is not a mere assemblage of techniques that a school counselor uses to \nwork with students or members of a school environment. Instead, ASE is an orientation that is \nconcerned with cultivating student capacities and creating just and complimentary schooling \nenvironments.  In this way, the theory is concerned with amplifying diversity, prizing a diversity \nof student experiences, and valuing a rich ecological diversity in a school that might provide \nample opportunities for student development. \nWhile ASE cannot be whittled down into techniques, it can inform specific school \ncounseling behaviors.  It has been used in manualized psychoeducational interventions delivered \nto whole classrooms or small groups of students (e.g., Lemberger & Clemens, 2012; Webb et al., \n2019) and teachers (Molina et al., 2022).  Furthermore, it can be used in various formats such as \nsmall and large group work, individual and planning activities in schools, and consultation, \ncollaboration, and advocacy in schools.  ASE practice integrates into various delivery \nframeworks including experiential activities, verbal counseling, and psychoeducational activities.  \nAlthough there are various applications, the practice of ASE is truly a theory intended to be a \nconceptual orientation that dictates spontaneous helping behaviors throughout the school \nenvironment.  \nThe 5Cs (curiosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution) of ASE \nare merely mnemonic devices intended for a school counselor\u2019s practice behaviors.  These \ndevices are not the full extent of intervention behaviors; instead, almost any appropriate school \ncounseling behavior that is concerned with cultivating student capacities while advocating for \nmore contributory environments is compatible with ASE theory.  As such, ASE theory can be \n\nactualized using transtheoretical counseling skills or even nascent techniques more closely \noriginated to ASE theory.  \nCuriosity \nCuriosity is a \u201cdrive state for information\u201d (Kidd & Hayden, p. 450); as a practice, \ncuriosity is the non-evaluative expression of inquisitiveness about one\u2019s circumstance and \nexperience.  In this way, the outcome of curiosity is not the acquisition of an unchanging or even \nideal end; rather, curiosity is a persistent openness to ongoing development.  \nAs an intervention focus, curiosity is foundational in establishing rapport with the student \n(or other recipients of school counseling services).  More than merely capturing information \nabout the student, the school counselor is eliciting and attending to the experiences of the \nstudent.  Assumingly, when a student experiences curiosity from a school counselor, it \nintroduces a new dimension of experience that is both germane to one\u2019s past determinants of \nexperience and also pertinent to nascent experience.   Curiosity expands the character of \nexperience.  \nFor example, consider the standard open-ended question often used by counseling \npractitioners.  Open-ended questions are intended to elicit information from the client, generally \nrequiring more than a simple response and generating client reflection.  From an ASE \nperspective, open-ended questions elucidate how one is capable of responding with intention to \none\u2019s influences (as self-within-environment).    \n\u201cWhat did you have for breakfast this morning?\u201d  This example question is certainly \nopen-ended, as it requires the respondent to answer with more than one or a few words.  But this \nis not an example of a fully curious question, for it inadvertently compels the child to restrict \ntheir answer to what one eats.  In so doing, the counselor is not curious about the student or the \n\nenvironment, as the student\u2019s family might be experiencing economic stressors and, therefore, \nnot typically have access to breakfast.  Not only is this question not curious, but it can also \npotentially rupture the trust of the student or incline the student to misrepresent experiences. \nAlternatively, asking the student, \u201cWhat are your typical morning rituals before school?\u201d \nis more fully curious as the onus is on the student to detail information and priorities.  The \nstructure of this more curious question is specific enough for the counselor to generate relevant \ninformation and yet unfurled enough that the student\u2019s experience is centered.  \nA school counselor can generate curiosity in more directive ways.  For example, in the \nStudent Success Skills program that has been associated with ASE theory (Webb et al., 2019), \nthere are many mantras that school counselors exercise with students that illustrate the practice \nof curiosity.  One example mantra is, \u201cDon\u2019t doubt your ability, try a different strategy.\u201d  \nAlthough this phrase is a directive initiated by the school counselor, it embodies curiosity in that \nit encourages the student to consider one\u2019s various capacities.  Further, it suggests that behaviors \ndo not fully define one\u2019s total constitution, but rather there are other manifestations that are \npossible.  Curiosity is concomitantly about one\u2019s prior determinants of experience and various \npermutations of new experience.  \nConnectedness \nConnectedness is the experience of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and respect \nshared between the student and other member of the school environment (Resnick et al., 1997).  \nWhereas one can be curious about an experience, connectedness pertains to the relational quality \nof that experience.  Curiosity can be exempt from value while connectedness acknowledges the \ninterrelatedness of experience and how necessary contributory relationships are for students and \nmembers of the school community.  \n\nStudent: I don\u2019t like sitting in class with them\u2026 (pause) those kids and that teacher\u2026 \n(pause) they\u2019re all pretty stupid, and they treat me like I am stupid.  \nSchool Counselor: It is frustrating to have to be in place and with people where there is \nnot a feeling of mutual respect. \nIn this short couplet, the school counselor utilized the classical counseling skill called \nreflection of feeling.  A generic reflection of feeling only requires the school counselor to \nidentify the student\u2019s most salient feeling and anchor it in some causal condition \u2013 you feel this, \nbecause.  An ASE reflection of feeling pertaining to connectedness validates the student\u2019s \nexperience while placing it in the context of the school environment.  Here the student\u2019s \nfrustration is experientially personal and yet provoked by what has occurred in the classroom.  \nOne of my (Matthew) more memorable experiences as a school counselor was working \nwith a sixth-grade boy named Michael.  He was universally feared throughout the school by \npeers, teachers, and administrators.  In fact, during my first week at this school, the principal was \ncontemplating expulsion from the district as a consequence of persistent fighting.  I asked the \nprincipal for one week to intervene as I knew a longer request would be met with resistance. \nI watched Michael in his classroom, on the playground at recess, and at lunch.  In each \nsetting, he was either sleeping or in some extreme conflict with others.  It didn\u2019t help that he was \none largest sixth graders I have seen, almost eye-to-eye with me at 6\u20193.  On the playground, other \nkids cowered away in mortal dread.  His relationships with teachers were equally adversarial, \nand each warned me that no matter how much kindness I extended, he would resist.    \nI didn\u2019t want to take total credence in the reports and the brief episodes I witnessed \nduring my brief observations, yet after a few introductory statements, it was clear that he was \nunimpressed and there was no inherent connection between him and me.  What came to mind \n\nwas, \u201cHe might be large like an adult, but there is a kid housed in that impressive stature.\u201d  \nGiven the little bit of time I had with him before expulsion, his outstanding history, and the \ncritical importance of supporting this young person, I tried something risky to inspire \nconnectedness.  \nSchool counselor:  I have been told that you have this amazing ability for new adults to \ntry and talk with you, and you can sit there and be completely unaffected and unimpressed.  As a \nschool counselor, I always want students to do their best at what they are the best at doing.  So, I \nam going to ask you a few questions, and I want you to continue to do what you do best, that is, \nsit there and not feel required to respond.  Just like you have a talent for sitting there and not \nresponding, I have a hidden talent too.  Without you answering, I have a pretty good hunch to the \nanswers of the questions I will ask you.  So I ask, you sit, and then I answer.  Cool?    \nStudent: (nothing; except doing what he did best to adults)\nSchool Counselor: Great!!! This seems to be working.  Okay, I can imagine that it can be \npretty lonely on the playground with no one wanting to play with you.  I also imagine that those \nfeelings of loneliness turn to anger pretty quickly, which could explain some of the fights.  \nStudent: (Smiling) How did you do that? \nThis story has many more details when I tell it to my graduate students, and I generally \nsuggest to them not to try this approach.  I don\u2019t typically recommend assuming you know your \nK12 student\u2019s experiences, but in this case, I had a real deadline with high stakes consequences \nfor his life.  What occurred after was that I told Michael that what I did was a kind of magic that \nwe all possess.  The magic was empathy.  For the next few weeks, he and I worked on \nanticipating the reactions of others and responding with empathy.  Certainly, there were \n\noccasions when he was being mistreated, but creating connections in these cases made him more \nable to control his internal experience and instigate change in those around him.  \nThis story illustrates the conceptual relatedness between ASE and social and emotional \nlearning (SEL) (Elias et al., 1997), which are competencies necessary to recognize and manage \nemotions, pursue goals, appreciate the perspectives of others, and interface constructively with \nothers.  From an ASE perspective, feelings of connectedness through SEL is not a prescription \nfor student compliance, rather it\nrefers to students\u2019 experiential discernment and the inclination to suspend pernicious \nidentification or evaluation of these experiences. Stated otherwise, students from \ndisenfranchised communities do not accept inadequate or deleterious social conditions; \ninstead, using social\u2013emotional and mindfulness strategies, they accept their cognitive \nand affective reactions and respond with clearer intentionality. (Lemberger-Truelove, et \nal., 2018(a), p. 299).\nCo-regulation \nAs a school counseling practice, co-regulation is the interface of two or more self-aware, \nintentional individuals who draw from various cultural, social, and personal sources to inform \nand influence behavior (McCaslin, 2009).  For example, a self-regulated individual can monitor, \npredict, shift, and direct one\u2019s internal and external experiences, whereas operating out of co-\nregulation one extends beyond one\u2019s inner experiences and places total experience in a broader \nsocial and historical context.   \u201cWhat have you done to improve yourself\u201d is different than \u201cHow \nhave you pursued your goals given the influences of (insert circumstance)?\u201d\nRecently I was working with a group of teachers at an elementary school.  As we \nconcluded a consultation session on teachers\u2019 stress responses in the classroom, we saw a \n\nteacher\u2019s aide disseminating snacks to the students.  One young boy was sitting at his desk \nbanging a cup vigorously on his desk, yelling, \u201cI want my milk, I want my milk\u2026!\u201d The teacher \nlooked over at me, and we had the following interchange: \nTeacher:  So, Dr. Expert, what would you do with this little darling?\nMe: (walking over to the student) I can hear from your song that you\u2019re really enthused to \nget your milk.  But I wonder, how can the teacher pour the milk into your cup if you are banging \nit upside down on the table? \nStudent: My milk would be all over the floor (as he turned his cup right side up).\nIn this episode, it would be easy to be recruited into the student\u2019s discontentment and \nover-eagerness.  It would also be easy to disregard the student\u2019s intentions or the habits of the \nclassroom.  Co-regulation engages the attentional and inhibitory control necessary for volition \nwhile not disregarding other students or desirable classroom procedures.  \nReturning to another SSS mantra, school counselors are encouraged to expose students to \nthe phrase, \u201cLittle by little, bit by bit, I am improving every day.\u201d  Students are encouraged to \nnotice and celebrate small yet important changes that contribute to larger aspirations.  This can \nbe a co-regulatory lesson for students if the school counselor prompts the students to consider \nenvironmental factors that contribute to or inhibit ongoing and intentional growth.  \nCompassion \nFor an ASE-inspired school counselor, compassion is the composed concern with either \npersistent or circumstantial feelings of suffering.  The etymology of compassion is com (to be \nwith) and passion (strong emotional connection).  Compassion is a precursor to empathy, \nfocused on ameliorating suffering or one\u2019s emotional reactivity.  From an ASE perspective, \n\ncompassion is a mechanism to break or slow down emotion-laden reactivity and introduce more \nco-regulated responsiveness. \nIn chapter 1, the concept of co-determinants of experience was explicated.  There are \nvarious social forces that contribute to contemporaneous experiences for students and other \nindividuals in schools.  For ASE theory, these are called governors.  Governors do not fully \ndictate experience, but they are the ingredients that profoundly influence both opportunity and \nresponse.  Compassion is a counterforce to the various personal and social governors of \nexperience.  \nThere are various strategies that the school counselor can use to vivify compassion when \nworking with students or school personnel.  A few examples include but are not limited to the \nfollowing framing (Rothman & Salovey, 1997), priming (Bargh & Chartrand, 2014), and \nmindfulness (Bishop et al., 2004).  In the case of mindfulness, there are various ASE intervention \nstudies with students (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2021) and teachers (Molina et al., 2022) to \nillustrate its utility.  Rather than becoming passive and compliant, ASE mindfulness can help \nelicit one\u2019s reactions to governed experiences and respond with greater compassion to these \nresponses. \nIn a similar way, school counselors can encourage compassion in teachers working with \nstudents.  By reframing student expressions as governed responses to the determinants of \nexperience, there can be greater connectedness and co-regulated intentionality in the classroom.  \nFurther, a teacher can extend compassion inward, especially when the tribulations of teaching are \nmost grueling.  \n\nThe spirit of compassion in the ASE approach is encapsulated in the following prompt \nprovided to classroom teachers in a recent consultation intervention study (Lemberger-Truelove \net al., in press): \nThe purpose is neither to invalidate an experience or even provide new, more appealing \nalternatives.  In the context of your experiences, any reaction is reasonable. Instead, we \nsimply want to interrogate your inner experience and some of its influences, which might \nlead to you coming to accept the experience as one response (acceptance). In this process \nof interrogation, other perspectives on experience might manifest (discernment). Again, \nthe purpose is not to invalidate or replace, but curiosity in these alternatives might allow \nyou to simultaneously appreciate the conditions of the initial experience while with \nnascent alternatives emerging, you can respond out of awareness of more options rather \nthan reacting to the impression that there is only one experiential option feasible \n(compassion for self and others).   \nContribution\nThe most aspirational intervention strategy in ASE theory is contribution, which is the \ncurious, connected, co-regulated, and compassionate commitment to action.  For the student, \ncontribution includes how one responds to the determinants of experience in and beyond the \nschool environment.  For the adults in the school environment, contribution includes the explicit \nbehaviors to advocate for student development.  \nContribution also demands that the student and other members of the school community \nact in solidarity for the purposes of social change.  This does not suggest compliance or \nassimilation, as ASE requires constant personal introspection and social revision; rather, there is \n\na shared and general agreement to participate in tangible behaviors to improve the school \nclimate. \nThe ASE informed school counselor must ardently ensure that contribution is not \nexploitative or trivial.  The action of contribution must be mediated by the other elements of the \n5Cs.  For example, a school counselor can partner with a teacher to eradicate ethnic and gender \nidentity discrimination in the school.  In so doing, the school counselor must consider one\u2019s own \nprivileges and ally with that teacher and the various students the advocacy will affect.  \nContribution demonstrates the liberation focus of ASE theory.  The process is the \noutcome; engaging in liberating experiences ushers in liberation at the individual level while \nembracing the inevitable situatedness within various systems.  A change in the student affects the \nschool environment, just as changes in the school affect the student.  \nASE and the Use of Time\nAdherents of ASE theory prioritize direct counseling and education school counseling \nservices that are intended to support students and the various adults in their lives.  While these \nvalue-added services are privileged, many school counselors are mired by other indirect and \nadministrative duties that can distance interventions from the desired targets.  It is often helpful \nfor the school counselor to think pragmatically about these other professional tasks.  In differing \nways, these activities affect the school environment, and therefore they have some potential \ninfluence on the experiences of students.  As such, rather than unthinkingly resist and resent \nthese opportunities, in the spirit of ASE, a school counselor should approach each task with the \nskill and perspective to amplify student opportunity and advocate for more contributory school \nenvironments.  \n\nThis recommendation is neither an endorsement of inappropriate school counseling duties \nnor permission for school counselors to passively adopt an identity or practices that are removed \nfrom counseling and education.  Instead, the suggestion is to reimagine each moment in a school \nas a potential contribution to the determinants of experience students and the people in their \nlives.  For example, while it is unequivocally inappropriate for a school administrator to use a \nschool counselor as a standardized testing coordinator or proctor, I (Matthew) vividly recall a \nstudent who benefited from me occupying such a role.  A student who I advised and who also \nparticipated in one of my small counseling groups was riddled with anxiety as the state mandated \ntest approached.  Upon seeing me walk into her classroom to disseminate the test materials, she \nsmiled at me and said, \u201cJust seeing you gave me confidence to make it through this test.\u201d  Prior \nto this moment, I used such vituperation when I was told that I had to suspend my meetings with \nstudents and hand out test papers; but in that instance, I realized that that student received as \nmuch or more educational and emotional value from our shared smile as she did in any advising \nsession or group meeting.\nThe use of a school counselor\u2019s time is so valuable.  Deciding how to prioritize one\u2019s \ncontribution to students and the total school environment can be layered and often dispiriting.  \nForemost, it is important to recognize that all cannot be accomplished at once and every action in \na school affects the total school system, in varying ways and in differing magnitudes of \ninfluence.  In this manner, what matters most is how one approaches each moment.  From an \nASE perspective, providing direct services to students matters, consulting with teachers and \nparents matters, maintaining data and self-reflective practices matters, and so on.  What binds \nthese different school counseling activities and usages of time together is the disposition of ASE; \n\nthat is, the ASE school counselor is led by intention to cultivate student capacities and improve \nschooling opportunities in all possible moments, regardless of the setting or activity.   \nThe ASE informed school counselor considers the likely magnitude of influence.  No \nschool counseling activity is zero-sum, yet the school counselor must be scrupulous how one\u2019s \nuse of time yields the deepest and most sustainable germination.  For example, a school \ncounselor does not engage students in small group activities simply because the ASCA National \nModel suggests a certain percentage of time performing such a task.  A school counselor does \nnot deliver a psycho-educational activity as a reflection of one\u2019s passion for a certain topic.  \nRather, a school counselor invests time and commits to intervention because the related activities \nproject more desirous outcomes.     \nEarlier in this chapter the phrase \u201cLittle by little, bit by bit, I am improving every \nday\u201d was introduced as a mechanism to encourage students to recognize persistent growth and \naccomplishment.  In the spirit of reflexive interventions, an ASE-inspired school counselor \ninverts this sagacious phrase and applies it to one\u2019s comprehensive school counseling program.  \nWith intention to amplify capacities of students and members of the school environment, over \ntime and across various aspects of educational systems, school counselors incrementally \ncontribute to people and systems better positioned to evolve and thrive.  \n\nReferences\nAmerican School Counselor Association.

An overview of key players, \ndistribution of power, resources, referrals, and how the school counselor intervenes to build upon \nthe capacities of school leaders to engage in activities that encourage co-regulation. Chapter 3 \nframes ASE through consultation efforts, focusing on skillsets to promote the development of \ninternal capacities of school faculty and staff while also directly advocating for student needs. \n\nCurrently, counseling within schools is under enormous scrutiny, regardless if a school \ncounselor or a school-based mental health counselor provides services. Herein lies the very \nrationale for this text: there needs to be an approach to working in the schools that systemically \ngrounds all school system members that further aligns with the school\u2019s mission and vision. ASE \nprovides that foundation as school counselors advocate for growth for their students and \nteachers, administrators, and family members. While ASE is a theory of practice, it is also a \ntheory of being. By embracing the approach of ASE in all interactions, the school counselor can \nencourage a double feedback loop within the school, whereby growth is incurred reflexively \nthrough all interactions. \nASE is grounded in the tenant of systemic change. To make that achievable, the school \ncounselor immerses themselves within the students\u2019 perception of their reality, which colors their \nperspective of their social circumstance. Understanding that perspective and how to function as \nan advocate for students is heavily influenced by the structure of the school\u2013 who are the key \nplayers, how is power distributed, whom to reference for topic-specific resources, and how to \nintervene to build upon the capacities of school leaders to engage in activities that encourage co-\nregulation. This chapter frames ASE through a leadership mentality, focusing on skillsets to \npromote the development of internal capacities of school faculty and staff while also directly \nadvocating for student needs. When considering a school's structure, many influencing factors \nreveal the systems in which an individual school is nested. This chapter focuses on a singular \nschool as a structure, utilizing terminology applicable within a distinct K-12 environment. \nWho\u2019s who in the school, and what do they do?\nPulling from structural therapeutic techniques (Minuchin, 1972), Physically organizing \nthe power structure of each subsystem can be incredibly helpful in understanding the school \n\nenvironment and identifying areas that may need to be changed (see figure 3.1). Each subsystem \nis differentiated by a boundary, which differs within every school. These boundaries are \nexperienced physically and emotionally as one considered accessibility to each subsystem. \nWithin ASE, the counselor must understand the undercurrent of power that impacts \nenvironmental functioning. Such power differentials and boundaries determine how each sub-\nsystem communicates to one another, either discouraging or encouraging communal relations \nbetween groups. This foundational understanding of the system makes counselors better \nequipped to join and accommodate. \nUnique to ASE, there is no ascribed curriculum whereby teachers or school counselors \nmust read from a script. Instead, it is a foundational understanding of creating connection, \ncommunicating respect for individual experience, and cultivating a sense of community through \njoining the already established system. Through dialectical relational skillsets, school counselors \npermeate the system to create change within each school subsystem, working within current \npower structures or striving to change power distribution through the alignment of shared goals. \nSchools have been seen to thrive when there is shared power and responsibility across \nstakeholders (Webster & Litchka, 2020). To decrease turnover rates within the school system, \nrecommended changes include considerations towards compensation, preparation, support, and \nschool leadership (Carver-Thomas & Darling-Hammond, 2017). School environments can \nintentionally be addressed through transparency of such boundaries, allowing for an equal flow \nof information, honoring perspectives, and engaging in dialogue with others.\nTo navigate the school and access resources to better advocate for the student, all school \nstakeholders, whether it be faculty, administration, parents, and student, need to understand who \nassumes which job titles, what their roles and responsibilities are, and where they are physically \n\nlocated. Below is a list of common roles within a typical school structure organized by the \nadministration, faculty, support staff, and external service providers. While not everyone a \nstudent may come into contact with is included (i.e., custodians, bus drivers, librarians), that does \nnot diminish their role or contribution to the school. Instead, the individuals listed below are \ncritical players in the decision-making process regarding student-based outcomes. \nAdministrators\nConsidering the structural map of the school in figure 2.1, administrators typically have \npower within the school setting. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining day-to-\nday operations, which largely dictate the culture of a school. Administrators must be on board to \npermeate the system and enact change throughout. The following provides a description of each \nrole as well as ways to create collaborative and supportive relationships to begin environmental \nchanges. \nPrincipal. With a presence in every elementary, middle, and high school, principals are \ngenerally responsible for overseeing all school operations, including setting academic goals and \nproviding teachers with resources and support to obtain those goals best. Often, principals are \nrequired to have a master\u2019s degree, usually in educational leadership. They are provided with the \nfoundation of various leadership theories and skill sets that will aid in their development to lead \nothers within educational settings. Numerous studies have investigated the efficacy of different \nleadership approaches on school outcomes (Chin, 2007). \nWithin the public school setting, academic goals are largely influenced by standards set \nforth by the district. The principal oversees such implementation and ensures teachers have all \nmaterials needed to administer programming successfully. Principals are also responsible for \noverseeing the well-being of all members within their schools. For example, efforts to support \n\nteachers often include providing mentorship, opportunities for professional development, and \noverseeing remediation or potential retention. These efforts have a trickledown effect on \nimproving students\u2019 lives; teachers feel supported in their roles in the classroom, and students are \nprovided with a conducive learning environment. \nPrincipals are encouraged to work collaboratively with school counselors for the \nbetterment of students, sharing essential goals rooted in student success (Dahir et al., 2010). \nHowever, there has been a historical lack of understanding regarding the school counselor\u2019s role \nwithin the school system. For example, principals often assign non-counseling-related activities \nto the school counselor, leaving them with the burden of attending to overwhelming \nadministrative tasks (Dollarhide & Lemberger, 2006). These tasks typically include scheduling, \ntesting administration, or discipline (Lowery et al., 2018). Research on principals\u2019 perceptions of \nthe school counselor\u2019s role shows that those perceptions are typically reflected within the actual \nschool counseling role (Lewis et al., 2022). The power a principal yields within a school is to the \nmagnitude that their vision is often encapsulated into practice. The more aligned these \nperceptions are with the ASCA National Model leads to a successful school counselor/principal \ncollaborative relationship (Lewis et al., 2022).  \nAssistant Principal. Assistant Principals (APs) interface with all school stakeholders, \noften engaging directly to mediate conversations between teachers, parents, students, and the \ncommunity. They perform administrative tasks as well as assist in the development of the master \nclass schedule and evaluate teacher performance. APs support teachers, ensuring that the \nmaterials taught in the classroom align with curriculum standards set forth by the district and \nprincipal. APs engage with students far more than the principal. They mediate the relationship \nbetween faculty, administration, family, and community. \n\nMost larger schools have a position of an assistant principal (AP) to aid the principal in \noverseeing and facilitating day-to-day operations. However, these roles and responsibilities differ \nnationwide as schools and districts have different needs. Because there is so much variety in how \nthis role is assumed, it may be challenging to provide formal training for APs. Much of the day-\nto-day decisions made by the AP are related to their previous experiences, whether direct with \nthe student, teacher, or parent. Alternatively, other APs note how decisions may contradict their \ninterpersonal styles, attempting to assimilate into the school system. These contradictions are \noften most noted in their role working on disciplinary infractions. From teacher instruction in the \nclassroom to student behavior, assistant principals\u2019 roles revolve around ensuring compliance. \nRegarding the role of disciplinarian, APs often comply with teacher demands which \ncenter around removing the problematic student from the classroom. However, in engaging in \nthis compliance on top of balancing the day-to-day responsibilities of school operation, APs \noften neglect the diverse needs of each student, feeling forced to get the job done rather than take \nthe time to explore the context behind each situation (Williams III et al., 2019). From an ASE \nperspective, the school counselors must support APs, providing consultation on discipline and \nencouraging exploration of the underlying issues that may present, promoting the ability to \nadvocate for the student within the environment. Simply engaging in disciplinary action without \ngaining contextual information regarding the student, joining them in their lived experience, \noften results in cultural blindness and disparities between how different groups of students are \ntreated. Receiving support from the school counselor using ASE can promote equity across all \nstudents while improving connection and outcomes. \nAdministrative Assistants. While the title of this role changes from school to school \n(administrator, secretary), the general role functions remain the same \u2013 the administrative \n\nassistant is in charge of directing the flow of people and information in and out of the school. \nThis person or multiple people are the first you engage with when entering or calling the school. \nThey provide information, give direction, and make connections. Some oversee creating and \ndistributing newsletters or emails regarding upcoming events. They communicate with parents, \nteachers, principals, and the community. The administrative assistants are essentially the school\u2019s \ngatekeepers, some ensuring outsiders follow safety procedures that enable them to enter the \nschool. They track when students arrive on time and if they need to leave early. They are the \nones parents speak to when their student is sick or has a doctor\u2019s appointment. \nDepending on the school size, many administrative assistants may serve under various \nadministration members. For example, a larger school's principal and assistant principal likely \nhave an administrative assistant to help with tasks related to coordination, planning, and \norganization of the tasks that make up daily school activities. They may have crucial roles in \nimplementing and reporting all fire or lockdown drills or organizing student bus transportation. \nWhenever there is a need from a student, teacher, or parent, the administrative assistant is the \none who connects them or directly provides them with the information needed. \nAdministrative assistants can be crucial in aiding the school counselor in gauging the \nschool\u2019s temperature. Their support can be essential in addressing ancillary duties that may \ndetract from direct student intervention. With this position also came a need for training and \ncontinued support by the school counselor. Administrators must understand the importance of \nconfidentiality regarding students, whether protecting their private educational information to \nbehavioral or discipline incidents. Understanding how information is shared and how such \ninformation significantly impacts the school's functioning is crucial. Providing training and \ncontinued support of administrators, whether by training principals and APs to oversee their \n\nstaff, modeling appropriate communication skill sets, or providing professional development, \nschool counselors can intervene with administrative assistants to change how information is \nshared throughout the school system and all related stakeholders. \nStudent Support Personnel \nThe following personnel work to coordinate efforts between all stakeholders to benefit all \nstudents. While the school counselor oversees all students' academic, social and emotional, and \ncareer development needs, student support personnel specialize in supporting specific \npopulations from students struggling with mental health-related disorders, support for learning \ndifficulties, and physical health concerns. While administrators oversee the school\u2019s general \noperations, student support personnel work directly with students to meet their needs. \nSchool Counselor. This text is written from the perspective of supporting school \ncounselors and school-based mental health professionals. A section on the school counselor is \nwarranted as the need to understand the ideal of the position and how that role navigates the \nsystem is essential in being able to advocate for the role and those served. Traditionally, the \nschool counselor is tasked with directly supporting student development in academics, career \naspirations, and social and emotional skillsets (ASCA, 2019). School counselors accomplish \nthese activities by directly interfacing with students through individual counseling, small group \ncounseling, classroom guidance, and consultation to implement comprehensive guidance \ncurriculums. \nTo ensure the support given to the student is effective, school counselors are also charged \nwith engaging in data-driven decision-making whereby they use student information to guide the \nprogramming offered within a multi-tiered system of support. For example, a needs assessment \nmay indicate that students struggle significantly with test anxiety school-wide. The school \n\ncounselor then focuses a component of their comprehensive guidance curriculum on stress \nreduction, mindfulness-based activities, or student success skills (Brigman & Webb, 2010). \nSchool counselors engage with all students through tier 1 intervention and classroom guidance \nlessons. Should they notice students continue to struggle after engagement in that format, school \ncounselors may form small groups with those who continue to struggle, intervening at the tier 2 \nlevel. Should the small group not suffice for some, school counselors utilize tier 3 intervention \nby engaging in individual counseling sessions. At that time, the school counselor would have \nample data to make an informed referral should the student need outside support. \nWhile most of the work focuses on direct contact with students, the school counselor \nserves as someone any school member can turn to for support, including working with teachers, \nparents, and administration. School counselors mediate parent-teacher conferences and meetings, \nutilizing counseling skill sets to encourage all members to feel heard and validated in their \nunique perspectives. The school counselor approaches these relationships to better the student \noutcomes. Should a teacher come to the school counselor regarding stress from a specific class, \nthe school counselor\u2019s efforts to support that teacher directly benefit the students within that \nclass. \nWhile the description above is ideal, the school counselor is often assigned ancillary \nduties, including testing coordination, student schedules, and other clerical duties. This, coupled \nwith limited classroom access due to teachers\u2019 stressors to meet mandated standards, decreases \nthe school counselor\u2019s ability to access all students. The school climate also dramatically impacts \nthe school counselor\u2019s ability to implement ideal programming, whether there is support from \nfaculty and administration or the communal needs of the school is nested in. Numerous factors \nimpact school counselor efficacy in the school. \n\nSchool-Based Mental Health Counselor.  Mental health needs amongst school-aged \nchildren continue to increase, especially in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. While these \nneeds may continue to rise, access to mental health care can be limiting for children, dependent \non parents to arrange and provide transportation to appointments after school hours. Given the \ndemand and high caseload experienced by school counselors, meeting students\u2019 mental health \ncare needs is not feasible. Therefore, schools will often contract or hire mental health counselors \nto serve in the school. School-based mental health counselors are trained in clinical mental health \nand usually specialize in working with children and adolescents.  \nSchool counselors and school-based mental health counselors are encouraged to work \ntogether in a collaborative relationship. As school counselors ascribe to implementing a \ncomprehensive guidance curriculum, it is unrealistic to meet the mental health needs of all \nstudents. Often, those who have worked through all three tiers of intervention are ready for an \noutside referral for further support (Christian & Brown, 2018). Rather than having that referral \nbe to a community counseling agency, school counselors can work closely with the school-based \nmental health counselor to ensure the transfer of services, consult on background information, \nand make a seamless transition. Furthermore, these services offered at the school allow all \nstudents to receive adequate mental health-based services, removing common barriers such as \naccess and affordability. \nSchool counselors and school-based mental health counselors are fully equipped to utilize \nASE throughout their practices. While both professionals are considered mental health experts, \neach has a unique experience that can be beneficial in consulting and collaborating. Considering \nthat clinical mental health counselors may not have extensive experience in the school setting, \nthe school counselor can take the opportunity during onboarding to provide background on ASE \n\nand how to work within the system. A common background and similar language can ease the \ntransition, allowing for an opportunity to share insights into navigating the system. Both \nrecognize the shared goal of meeting students\u2019 social, emotional, and mental health needs. \nEstablishing that collaborative relationship will allow for success. \nExceptional Student Education Coordinator. Between 2020 and 2021, 15% of all \npublic school students received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA). The exceptional student education (ESE) coordinator oversees all ESE \nstudents and ensures the services each student receives best meet their educational needs. In \norder to do so, ESE coordinators work with students, parents, counselors, and other stakeholders \nto prepare individual education plans (IEP) for each student and ensure accommodations are put \ninto place. The ESE coordinator continuously monitors student progress to ensure those \naccommodations that are put into place are effective and allow the student to meet their \nidentified goals. ESE coordinators must comply with national laws consistent with the \nindividuals with disabilities act. \nESE coordinators work closely with all student support personnel to ensure students \nreceive equitable opportunities as their general education peers. Such supports include ensuring \naccess to external supports and resources. School counselors working from the ASE perspective \nunderstand that students with individual education plans have unique experiences and needs, \noften struggling socially, emotionally, and academically. Collaborating on the IEP process \nallows consultation efforts to be applied with all supporting the student, including the parent, \nteacher, school counselor, and all other external support. Utilizing ASE in this process promotes \nthe opportunity to allow each stakeholder to share their experiences and model a dialogue \n\nconnection. Everyone at the table can feel heard in a process often overwhelming for parents and \nteachers. \nNurse. The school nurse is a registered nurse who helps students with the treatment and \nprevention of medical issues and ailments and coordinates routine health assessments. The \nschool nurse is a resource for all things physically related to students. They aid in medication \ndissemination should medications need to be taken during the school day and fix up scraped \nknees from the playground. The nurse provides health education to students and coordinates \nvision, hearing, and speech assessments. \nWhile a school nurse\u2019s role may be self-explanatory, they are often an underutilized \nresource within the school system. The school counselor can consult with the school nurse on \nsituations whereby a student\u2019s physical health may impede their ability to perform. The school \nnurse can also assist in identifying students struggling with underlying mental health struggles as \nchildren experience emotional distress through somatic complaints (headaches, stomach aches, \nexhaustion, etc.). Student support personnel can work together to ensure students receive access \nto all supports within the system, increasing access to social and emotional support and mental \nhealth services. \nFaculty \nFaculty are the heart of a school. Faculty work with students all day, often knowing what \nis going on in their lives inside and outside school. It is through the faculty-student interaction \nthat learning occurs. Within that interaction comes the opportunity for co-regulation. Within \nASE, co-regulation is a foundational factor referring to the interaction of two self-aware \nindividuals. Becoming self-aware requires intentional reflection on ones self as well as reflection \non those around you. School counselors can aid faculty and students to enhance their self-\n\nawareness, students through the comprehensive guidance curriculum, and faculty through \nprofessional development and consultation. Through support, faculty can genuinely change the \nenvironment and encourage the development of optimal student outcomes. \nIn practice, the ASE consultation model has been seen to increase teachers\u2019 awareness \nand attention to the present and decrease stress within the classroom (Molina et al., 2022). As \nteachers increase their self-awareness, they can better engage in a co-regulatory relationship with \ntheir students, changing the nature of the environment. Acting with co-regulation within the \nclassroom environment allows teachers to see beyond the student\u2019s behavior, identifying that \nsuch actions extend beyond the student's capacity and speaks to a myriad of factors. Teachers \nreflect on their own experiences within each moment and how their experiences impact their \nstudents. Similarly, as students engage in their own ASE curriculum, they also experience \nincreased self-awareness, promoting the ability to engage in the co-regulation process. The \nimpact ASE has on teacher satisfaction is profound, especially considering the high rate of \nteacher burnout, decreased perceptions of self-worth, and depressive symptoms (M\u00e9ndez et al., \n2020). School counselors using ASE as a model for consultation and professional development \nallows for repeated exposure to ASE, providing that foundation through professional \ndevelopment and continuous reinforcement through modeling and encouragement within the \nconsultation.  \nGeneral Education Teachers. As defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a \nteacher\u2019s role is to instruct students in various basic subjects that prepare them for future \nschooling (2022).  The homeroom teacher is your student\u2019s main point of contact in an \nelementary school setting. They are engaged in their daily learning activities and exposed to their \nsocial growth and developmental milestones. At the high school level, a student has exposure to \n\nnumerous teachers, all of whom have different experiences and perspectives on the student. \nTeachers work with all other members of the school system, especially parents and other support \npersonnel, to best meet their students\u2019 needs. Teachers work beyond the time they are in the \nclassroom, using evenings and weekends to prepare lessons or grade papers. They utilize \nclassroom management skills and ensure lessons align with a developmentally appropriate \ncurriculum. As with many other school professionals, teachers are often tasked with ancillary \nduties within an ever-changing educational environment. Given such, it is found that many \nteachers are plagued with burnout, leaving the classrooms for more favorable work environments \nwith increased accessibility has given advancements in technology. This is more true for teachers \nwith fewer than 11 years of experience in teaching (Kim & Seo, 2018), teachers with a specialty \nin STEM, or special education teachers (Nguyen, 2020). Overall, teacher satisfaction, \ncommitment to their jobs, and feelings of self-efficacy are all impacted by the environment set \nforth by leadership in school administration (Cansoy et al., 2020; Kim & Seo, 2018). \nSpecial Education Teacher. Special education teachers work with students who struggle \nwith unique learning abilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, and physical disabilities (U.S. \nBureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). While general education teachers use a standard curriculum, \nspecial education teachers must modify instruction to best meet the needs of their students, often \nin one on one or small group settings. In working with students whose needs constantly change, \nspecial education teachers must continuously monitor their student\u2019s progress to make informed \ndecisions about their individualized education plans and communicate any changes with parents, \nother teachers, and outside service providers. Considering the intense stressors of working with a \nhigh-needs population, there is a shortage of special education teachers and a high rate of \nburnout (Carver-Thomas & Darling-Hammond, 2017; McLeskey et al., 2004). \n\nTeacher Aides. Also titled a paraprofessional or instructional assistant, a teacher aide is \nin place for students with special learning circumstances to provide academic, social, and \nbehavioral support (Howard & Ford, 2007). The structure of schools has shifted significantly \nover time, especially with consideration to meeting the needs of special education students. \nRather than pulling out those with special learning needs and placing them into exclusion \nclassrooms, schools now practice from an inclusive setting, ensuring all students have access to \nthe same structures and supports regardless of their unique learning needs. This shift in learning \nstructures leads to a need for more hands in classrooms where students may need increased \nsupport that exceeds the classroom teacher's capacity. For example, students that struggle with \nemotional or behavioral disorders (see chapter 6) benefit significantly from having someone they \ntrust to help them manage difficult situations. Instructionally, teacher aides support students \nthrough direct instruction, such as reviewing specific concepts discussed in class, and indirect \ninstruction, whereby they monitor students\u2019 completion of work (Howard & Ford, 2007). \nTeacher aides may have a more robust and detailed perspective of a student that differs from the \nclassroom teacher, given the time and intensity by which they connect to their students.\nExternal Supports\nThe following include support services that may float between multiple schools. This \npersonnel may not be included in the day-to-day interactions; however, it is vital to know that \nsuch services are accessible to any student who may need them. Faculty and student support staff \nmust communicate with these individuals to track progress and meet student needs. Since these \nexternal service providers float between many schools, they may not have the opportunity to \nengage in professional development opportunities to receive direct training on ASE. Regardless, \nthese providers are essential in providing necessary services that promote growth in human \n\ncapacity, further promoting the student\u2019s ability to self-advocate. All student support personnel \nneeds to be aware of these services so they can be utilized to best meet the needs of all students. \nSchool Psychologist. The primary duty of a school psychologist comes into the realm of \ntesting and evaluation for students in need of special services. Such assessments may be \nconducted by pulling a student from their classroom to complete valid and reliable assessments \nor observe student behavior in various learning environments. School counselors then \ncommunicate their findings to the school during an individual education planning meeting. In \nasking for feedback on roles and responsibilities, school psychologists reported their primary \nrole as conducting student assessments but wished they could engage in more counseling-related \nactivities (Agresta, 2004). Newer school psychologists find their consultation efforts did not \nalign with problem-solving consultation models, preventing effective collaboration to support \nstudents through a multi-tiered system of support (Newman, 2018). Feedback on each effort \nincluded a need for collaboration between all members of the school system, working towards \nthe betterment of the students in need. Supported students lead to supported teachers, improving \nclassroom environments and transcending into school environment improvements. \nSocial Worker. In the school setting, social workers are mental health professionals who \nprovide direct and indirect support services to students regarding their social, emotional, and life \ncircumstances (School Social Work Association of America, 2022). More specifically, social \nworkers conduct mental health assessments, respond to crises in emergencies, and connect \nstudents and their families to community resources such as emergency housing, food programs, \nor healthcare (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  School social workers report feeling \noverwhelmed by caseloads and culturally diverse school environments, making it challenging to \nimplement empirically supported practices (Horton & Prudencio, 2022). Recommendations for \n\nbest practices include increased training for social workers to take a more collaborative role \nwithin the schools, understanding the dynamics of the various groups, and how to work together \nto make systemic change. \nSpeech and Language Pathologist. Another professional that provides services outside \nschool environments, a speech-language pathologist (SLP), plays a crucial role in the school \nsetting. SLP work with students through prevention, assessment, intervention, and individual \neducation planning input within the school setting (American Speech-Language-Hearing \nAssociation, 2022). While SLPs are equipped to conduct student assessments, they often rely on \noutcomes from standardized testing to identify students needing service (Flucher-Rood et al., \n2018). SLPs are another professional at the table to collaborate with faculty, student support \nservices, and administration to meet students\u2019 needs. \nPhysical Therapist. While physical therapy might be a practice seen more often in \nhospitals, private practice, or rehabilitation centers, they are also viewed as a crucial member of \nschool-based teams. School-based physical therapists provide appropriate services for students \nwith disabilities to prepare them for future education, employment, and independent living \n(American Physical Therapy Association, 2022). Should students struggle with adapting to \nactivities within a typical school day (i.e., using the playground, climbing stairs, walking over \nvarious terrains), a physical therapist may assess the student, identifying areas to intervene. \nAssessment results are communicated to the school in adapting a student\u2019s individual education \nplan, accounting for possible physical therapy services to aid the student in fully engaging in the \nschool environment (Kaminker et al., 2004). \nOccupational Therapist. Like the role of physical therapists, occupational therapists \nbased in the school provide services to students in need to ensure they can take part in everyday \n\nschool-based activities. School-based activities related to fine motor development span from \nhandwriting and scissor abilities to functionally using utensils or opening lunch containers. \nOccupational therapists engage in student observation, assessment, and continual evaluation. \nThey develop recommendations and treatment plans which are then implemented into the \nstudent\u2019s individual education plan. Furthermore, they educate students, parents, and teachers \nabout the needs of the students, providing recommendations for accommodations or educating on \nexercises and stretches that may be helpful outside of therapy sessions. Occupational therapists \nregularly consult with school teams to meet the needs of students and encourage positive student \noutcomes (Villeneuve, 2009).\nUsing ASE to Change the School Environment\nEffecting change throughout the school environment begins with providing a foundation \nof ASE throughout the school system. Such can be accomplished through professional \ndevelopment workshops, then reinforced within consultation. The workshops provide a \nmindfulness curriculum in addition to social and emotional learning dialogue prompts (Molina et \nal., 2022), which is reinforced through consultation grounded in embracing curiosity, \ncompassion, connectedness, and co-regulation through each interaction and modeled through \ndialogical connection within consultation. An embodiment of these tenants leads to full capacity \nof contribution. \nGiven that the principal usually yields the most power within the school system, the \nschool counselor must utilize ASE to form collaborative relationships rooted in advocacy and \nshared goals related to student outcomes. School counselors can use their comprehensive \nguidance curriculum, which is informed by data and grounded in ASE, to demonstrate a plan for \neach school year. By being grounded in ASE, the comprehensive curriculum presents the theory \n\nof change, identifying how each intervention tier relates to the student\u2019s experience in the here \nand now. Tier 1 intervention, seen through classroom guidance lessons, is focused on building \nstudents' internal capacities to promote the betterment of life outcomes. As discussed in chapter \nfive, these internal capacities are linked to positive student outcomes such as increased \nattendance, academic achievement, and decreased discipline referrals. Those students who \nstruggle with the tier 1 intervention are then encouraged to participate in tier 2 intervention, \nsmall group counseling, focused on continuing to build those internal capacities but allowing for \nmore space to explore the student experience. Tier 3 intervention refers to short-term individual \ncounseling. The school counselor embraces the 5 C\u2019s of ASE in each tier. Presenting a semester \nplan, as informed by school-based data, grounded in ASE, with identified outcomes related to \nstudent success, provides a tool to gain principal support and buy-in. When these plans are \ncreated collaboratively, the principal\u2019s contribution increases commitment. \nIn training others, counselors encourage school stakeholders to embrace curiosity. \nCuriosity relates to the counselor\u2019s empathetic ability, the willingness to be open with students \nand stakeholders, and comprehend unique circumstances related to the environment. In training \nothers to be leaders within the school, counselors encourage leaders to engage in curiosity, listen \nempathetically to what others in the environment have to say, and fully understand that, \nregardless of truth, what is communicated is the truth of that individual\u2019s experience. Leaders \ncan be taught to utilize language that encourages dialogue of other experiences. For example, a \nprincipal may ask a teacher, \u201cWhat did you do differently that led to successful outcomes this \nweek?\u201d. While dialogue can change, the key component is that leaders utilizing the ASE \nmodality care about the response, leading to compassion. \n\nConsidering curiosity specifically from the context of the school system, the school \ncounselor needs to understand what drives each system member\u2019s behavior. For example, APs \noften report feeling that discipline-based decisions are consistent with the system as opposed to \ntheir training or prior professional experiences. Supporting APs in understanding the school \nsystem's environmental context and their own experiences and training is essential for change. \nAn AP can have every intention of bettering the environment for students, but getting swept up \nin an often overwhelming role can lead them towards assimilation rather than advocating for \nchange and taking action to see that change occur. Without these supports, the system cannot \nevolve, remaining homeostatic as people of power enter the system and assimilate to the current \nstandard. \nWhile in practice, compassion, leaders validate the various experiences communicated to \nthem by those within their environment. However, in that validation does not come blind \nacceptance. A leader can understand each side of a \u201che said, she said\u201d argument that leads two \nstudents to the assistant principal\u2019s (AP) office. Each student had an experience whereby they \nbelieved they were justified in their responses. While validating that experience is essential, so is \nmediating the information. Considering Rapoport\u2019s rules, a conversation may look like this: \nStudent 1: They started it! They said mean comments, and his arm came flying towards \nme! \nStudent 2: I did not. They started it! They wouldn\u2019t stop talking! And they hit me first! \nAP: It sounds like you both have different perspectives on how this fight evolved and \nwho should be responsible. Rather than focusing on who is responsible, we need to \nunderstand what led each of you to respond with violence. \nStudent 1: Because they attacked me! \n\nAP: When we feel attacked, it is natural to respond with strong feelings. Sometimes we \ncan feel attacked just by words. This leads us to feel sad and angry. Before you both \nstarted physically fighting, what was happening in the classroom that led to such strong \nemotions?\nAs seen within this vignette, the AP communicates curiosity and compassion, even in a situation \nthat typically results in punitive measures. If both parties feel supported and validated, they are \nmore likely to view their roles in the situation and identify personal goals centered around their \nstrengths. Leaders must also be mindful of co-regulation and aware of their social and emotional \ncapacities to regulate. For example, counselors and leaders utilizing an ASE leadership modality \ncan also increase their social and emotional learning skillsets to better coregulate within their \nenvironment. That is, they can internally practice and strengthen capacities of emotional \nintelligence, which includes identifying thoughts and emotions, understanding these emotions, \nand managing them within us and others (Mayer et al., 2000). This reflexivity encourages leaders \nto consider their practices, evaluate their efficacy, and make necessary changes. \nShould most situations be approached with this spirit, members of the school \nenvironment would inherently feel more connected to one another. Connectedness allows leaders \nto assess the school environment adequately. Students thrive when in an environment in which \nthey feel safe and secure. Alternatively, when disconnected, students are often disengaged, \nfearful of not feeling rooted in their environment, and often display maladaptive behaviors such \nas not doing homework or acting out. Connectedness allows the counselor or school leader to \nknow what areas within the environment warrant intervention. For example, disconnection \nbetween students and teachers may result in students acting out behaviorally within the \nclassroom and teachers\u2019 increased dissatisfaction. Seeing this disconnect, counselors and \n\nprincipals can intervene to mediate the relationship between these two highly connected groups, \nadvocating for student needs within the environment while attending to the needs of teachers and \nsupporting their ability to provide quality experiences for their students. \nFinally, the culmination of these consultation efforts results in contribution. The base of \nany leadership endeavor is foundationally supported by the desire to improve the school \nenvironment through curiosity, compassion, coregulation, and connectedness. Contribution is not \nmotivated by inherent wants and needs. Instead, it is informed by the needs of the students, \nleading from a socially just capacity. \nConclusion\nCounselors are encouraged to work with other members of the school environment to aid \nin the creation of safe and stable social conditions by which effective learning can take place \n(Lemberger -Truelove & Bowers, 2019). Counselors can provide professional development \nworkshops and consultation efforts to key stakeholders outlined in this chapter to aid in their \npersonal actualization of internal capacities, fostering the development of co-regulation, which is \nthe crux for environmental change within ASE. When working for the betterment of students, all \nstakeholders need to be on the same page. All school system members must be allowed to \npractice skillsets that highlight their strengths. The environmental impact of ASE promotes the \ndelicate balance of responding to the complex needs of the environment as well capacities of all \nmembers within that environment (Bowers & Lemberger, 2018). This chapter explored the \nvarious subsystems within the school environment, identifying how ASE can encourage \nenvironmental change. While there is an inherent focus on co-regulation, the following chapters \nwill dive further into the concept of internal capacities, which speaks to the areas of growth for \nall stakeholders. \n\nReferences\nAgresta, J.

What\u2019s your name?\nStudent:\u00a0I'm Mia.\nCounselor:\u00a0Hello, Mia! It's really nice to meet you. What brings you to counseling today?\nMia:\u00a0My teacher sent me to come see you.\nCounselor:\u00a0What might you think are her reasons to have you see me?\nMia:\u00a0I don't know. Sometimes I just get mad.\nCounselor:\u00a0You experience anger. What kind of things make you feel mad?\nMia:\u00a0When other kids don\u2019t listen to me or when I can\u2019t do something right.\nCounselor:\u00a0That sounds really frustrating. It's challenging when things don't go the way we want \nthem to. What do you do when you feel mad?\nMia:\u00a0Sometimes I yell or throw things. I don't mean to, but it just happens.\nCounselor:\u00a0To you, anger appears to take over your choices. I wonder if there are any things that \nyou typically feel or think just as that anger is starting to take over.  \nMia: Like what? \nCounselor: It is different for different people, and it is normal for different people to feel and even \ndo different things when they are frustrated and angry.  Some people feel something in their body, \nlike heating up or even pain while other people might have words or imagines appear. \nMia: Oh.  Yeah, that can sometimes happen to me.  I don\u2019t know.  \nCounselor: Maybe you can tell me about a recent time when you felt angry.  \nMia: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m bored. \nCounselor: Talking about anger might be a little frustrating too. \nMia:  It\u2019s not the same.  \nCounselor: Can you tell me how talking about your anger is different than actually feeling anger? \nMia: I mean, you didn\u2019t really do anything to me, so I am not angry. I am just bored. Adults always \nwant talk to me after I get in trouble and that\u2019s boring. \nCounselor: What is another way you\u2019d prefer an adult like me to act after you get frustrated or \nangry?         \n\nMia: Just leave me alone. \nCounselor: So by leaving you alone, your anger will go away?  \nMia: No. I just won\u2019t be bored talking about it. \nCounselor: That makes sense, boredom probably doesn\u2019t seem like the feelings one would need to \nstop frustration or anger.  \nPause \nLet\u2019s not spend too much time on feelings that won\u2019t help with anger.  I wonder have you ever felt or \ndone something that made the frustration or anger settle a bit, without boring you?  \nMia:\u00a0Not really. I just get too mad.\nCounselor: It does sound really hard to stop anger.  Maybe let\u2019s not try and stop it completely, at \nleast not at first.  Instead, let\u2019s start with how anger eventually turns into something else.  Can you \ntell me what its like when anger changes to any other feeling for you? \nMia:  I don\u2019t know. I guess it just changes.  I don\u2019t really think about it.  I forget about it. \nPause\nOr I just think about something else. I can still be angry, but not all the way angry like before. \nCounselor: That\u2019s a really cool ability you have.  It is like you are stacking a new feeling on top of \nthe old angry feeling.  This is kind of the opposite of what you said earlier when you suggested that \nthe anger just takes over.  It is like the one feeling and with only one feeling, there is only one \nbehavior that you can do \u2013 act with anger. But when anger goes away for you, there is more than just \nthat one feeling and therefore there can be more than one way to act.  \nMia:  I guess.  (Pause). Maybe anger just goes away. \nCounselor: Does it go away for you?\nMia: Kinda.  (Pause)  I. mean, not all the way away. I still feel pissed off at what made me angry.  I \njust don\u2019t feel as mad.  (Pause). I mean, I guess you\u2019re right that I feel a little mad but also other \nthings too. \nCounselor: What type of other things can you feel after you\u2019ve experienced uncontrollable angry?\nMia:  Anything. I guess. Sometimes I can even be happy, if people stop messing with me or I don\u2019t \nthink about what made me angry or if I go do something fun.\nCounselor: I learning so much about this ability that you have to control your anger.  Earlier you \nsaid that you don\u2019t think about what made you angry, but it sounds like so much more than that.  \n\nWhat I hear you saying is that you join the anger experience with other experiences and feelings, and \nthen some new feeling emerges that is a little bit the anger but mostly something new. \nMia:  I guess that\u2019s true.  I never really thought of like that.  \nCounselor: You never really thought about how much control you have over your feelings?\nMia: No, I just feel what I feel. Something happens and then it makes me feel something.  I cannot \nalways control that.  \nCounselor:  Something bothers you and then you feel the anger. \nMia:  Yeah.  It is not my fault.  People should just leave me alone and then I will not be so angry. \nCounselor:  This makes sense and I am learning so much.  So something happens and then the \nfeeling of anger comes on uncontrollably.  And then later, other things happen and your feelings \nbegin to change.  \nMia: Yeah. Like everyone. I am not the only one who gets angry or acts this way.          \nCounselor:\u00a0That\u2019s certainly true, generally all people get angry, even if only occasionally and for \nshort periods of time.  But there is more to your story and it sounds like you\u2019re not giving yourself \nenough credit here.  First, something happens and then you are controlled by normal feelings of \nanger. Second, other stuff happens and then you\u2019re not so controlled by the anger. The anger might \nstill be there, but now, later, you can apparently pick and choose to not be fully controlled by it. \nMia:  I mean I guess so. I am not always angry, but I am a lot of the time. \n Counselor: Things can be challenging. If the anger is controlling, except when you start to feel \nother things, I wonder what would occur if you used this ability to mix other feelings in when you \nstart to feel angry?  \nMia: Like what? \nCounselor: Well, maybe tell me a little about the last time you were angry with your teacher who \nhad you come to see me today.\nMia:  I was talking to my friend in class and the teacher was rude to me.  She made me so mad. \nCounselor: You felt angry when she interrupted your conversation with your friend. Let\u2019s not let go \nof that feeling of anger, because we can agree that it is normal to feel angry when a conversation \nwith a good friend is stopped. But can you tell me a few of the additional feelings you might have \nafter this normal anger changes? \nMia:  I don\u2019t know. I will still be mad at her.  But I guess later I will feel bored in class. \nCounselor: Yes, and when you\u2019re bored, are you controlled by the anger?  \n\nMia: (chuckles) You want me to be bored?   \nCounselor: Boredom is as normal as is anger.  But this truth shows us that we are not fully stuck in \none feeling, even if we still feel that emotion. It also shows us that we are not fully controlled by that \none feeling.  \nMia: But its hard when you are feeling that mad.  \nCounselor:  Agreed. When you have one feeling, it is difficult for most people to control.  Control \nsuggest that you have multiple options.  So maybe to get a bit of control of anger, you need lots of \ndifferent feelings when something happens that frustrates you.  \nMia: How can I have lots of feelings when I am just mad? \nCounselor: You said that it is hard to control yourself when you are angry, what would it be like if \nyou didn\u2019t try and let go of the anger but once you recognize that feel anger, you can try and add in \nsome other feelings and thoughts? \nMia: But what if I do something to get myself in more trouble before I have another feeling?    \nCounselor: That sounds like what is happening to you now.  I am guessing that it won\u2019t always be \neasy to do all of the time, but I do wonder if you practice now with me adding more feelings to your \nexperiences, if you might be less controlled because you have more choices how to feel and act?\nMia: Like what?  What if I just want to be angry?    \nCounselor: That is a great question. What I am asking you to consider, you still get to be angry.  \nAgain, it is normal to be angry.  What we are considering is how much more choice you might have \nif you can be angry plus some other feelings.  \nMia: I don\u2019t like to be controlled.  That also makes me angry.  So maybe. \nCounselor: I can see how challenging that would be; something makes you angry, and then that \nfeeling of anger controls your feelings and actions. Then you probably even get angrier because \nyou\u2019ve been controlled or how to do with the consequences of being controlled by anger. \nMia: Yeah. \nCounselor: Anger and control can be difficult to challenge.  Like we agreed, it is normal. So maybe \nit would be helpful to find someone or some time to practice when it is safer and when you have a \nbit of control of the situation.  \nMia: Like what? \nCounselor: You and I can try this when we meet in future weeks.  But in the meantime, I wonder if \nyou can practice with feelings that are not so controlling.  You mentioned boredom earlier, or maybe \neven a positive emotion.  Any time is fine, but each day, take a moment and pick out a specific \n\nfeeling, take a breath, and then simply examine how you are affected when you try and control your \nfeelings by adding new feelings to that situation.  \nMia: What if I don\u2019t remember? \nCounselor: Yeah, don\u2019t try and over control this exercise.  Let\u2019s you and I think of a safe and easy \nthing coming up in your life that you can try this out.\nMia: Well, I have to go back to class, I guess I could try there.   \nCounselor: Just to clarify what you suggested, when you start to notice that you\u2019re feeling some \nemotion that about to control your actions, simply accept that feeling, don\u2019t push it away, but add to \nit some other emotion and see how it affects your control.  \nMia: Yeah, I can do that.  \nCounselor: And maybe next week after we check in to see how that affected things, and if it helped \nwe can come up with some other things to make this strategy easier and something you can do \noften; or if it doesn\u2019t work, what adjustments can we make to add yet something else to loosen the \ncontrol of anger on you.", "Print1.pdf": "Chapter 1: \nAn Introduction to the Advocating Student-within-Environment Theory \nfor Middle and High School Counselors\nBy: Matthew E. Lemberger-Truelove\n \nSchools are incredibly complex communities, abounding with students, educators, and \nvarious other professional and non\u2014professional individuals. Beyond the people themselves, \nthere exist elaborate webs constituted of academic and social expectations, interpersonal \nrelationships, and broader societal influences that each influence the lives of all people involved \nin schooling. Running alongside the people and dynamics are school counselors who support \nboth individuals and the school as a whole. One approach intended to inspire how school \ncounselors engage with the interacting determinants found in schools is the Advocating Student-\nwithin-Environment (ASE) theory (Lemberger, 2010, Lemberger & Hutchison, 2014; \nLemberger-Truelove & Bowers Parker, 2024).   \nAt its core, ASE theory focuses on cultivating each student\u2019s capacities to thrive in and \nbeyond the school environment. In parallel, adherents of ASE embrace that school counselors \naddress the immediate needs of individual students but also advocate for systemic changes to \ncreate a more supportive and inclusive environment for all students. This dual focus aims to \nfoster a school climate where all members of a school community can flourish by developing the \nagency and the skills necessary to navigate learning, social, and vocational opportunities and \nchallenges.\nASE theory contends that personal and social experiences are interwoven, shaping each \nindividual in profound ways. It emphasizes prior determinants of experience\u2014including all \nbiological, psychological, cultural, and environmental factors\u2014that influence students\u2019 \nindividual experiences and trajectories (Lenz & Lemberger-Truelove, 2023). While building a \n\nsupportive environment, ASE does not prescribe how communities should ideally manifest; \ninstead, it fosters an adaptive, reflective approach, allowing individuals and communities to \nemerge organically and reflexively. \nPractitioners working from an ASE perspective acknowledge that, while schools are \nintended to support individual growth, they have at times failed to serve the best interests of all \ngroups. School counselors practicing ASE theory consider both the immediate and the long-term \nroles of students, educators, and other school stakeholders within and beyond the school. While \ntraditional interventions may focus on improving students' current functioning, ASE encourages \na broader perspective, asking how students might also influence and shape various communities \nthey reside in throughout their lives. This approach highlights the importance of fostering critical \nconsciousness, or \"sapience,\" which equips students with the wisdom and awareness needed to \nnavigate and transform limited, oppressive, or restrictive environments. ASE aims to empower \nstudents to transcend limiting social structures and influence broader social systems in propitious \nways (Freire, 1970; 1973).\nASE theory asserts that while schools are designed to activate students\u2019 inner capacities, \nthe counselor\u2019s role is also to challenge and support the larger system by creating conditions for \ngrowth. Counselors work to develop students\u2019 executive functioning and other generalizable \nskills that are applicable across various areas of life. These capacities are bolstered by improving \nschool conditions\u2014such as teacher-student relationships, school climate, and inclusion \npractices\u2014which allow all students to flourish. ASE-informed interventions aim to be \npreventative, developmental, and reflexive, supporting the personal and social conditions that \nlead to lasting wellness.\n\nIn advocating for both individual and systemic change, ASE theory recognizes the \nconcept of \"governors,\" which are influences that either contribute to or detract from a student's \nwell-being and development. Unlike the term \"determinants,\" which implies fixed outcomes, \n\"governors\" suggest that these influences are variable and adaptable. By identifying and \naddressing contributory and detracting governors, ASE counselors help students to navigate their \nenvironments in ways that are both personally meaningful and socially beneficial.\nASE is rooted in the belief that students benefit from the enhancement of both personal \ncapacities and supportive environments. Central to ASE theory are five core conceptual and \npractice values\u2014Curiosity, Connectedness, Co-regulation, Compassion, and Contribution. \nTogether, they foster a sixth and seventh values, Composition and Community, which unites \nindividual strengths within a shared environment. The primary goal is to prepare students for \nfuture opportunities and challenges, emphasizing the importance of nurturing capacities rather \nthan focusing solely on specific ways of being or behaviors. This perspective suggests that \npersonal and social development is more than merely complying with current norms, rather \nstudents and school personnel are encouraged to build adaptability that is pointed at continuous \ngrowth and wellness at the personal and societal levels.\nASE and the Developmental Fitness with Adolescence\nAdolescence is a critical developmental period, generally punctuated by youths\u2019 urge to \nestablish a distinct identity while at the same time forging important social connections.  As \nsuch, ASE theory emphasizes the complex interactions between an adolescent\u2019s internal \ncharacteristics (e.g., personal history, mental health, and self-concept) and the external influences \nof their environment (including family, peer groups, culture, and school systems). This holistic \nperspective informs how school counselors work with adolescents, emphasizing that advocacy \n\nactivities performed by the counselor can create more facilitative environments to complement \nand amplify students\u2019 personal development achieved in counseling or other growth intended \nexperiences.  \nA unique conceptual consideration for counselors in ASE theory is the emphasis \non adolescent identity development. Adolescence is a crucial period for self-exploration and \nidentity formation, with students beginning to solidify their personal beliefs, values, and goals. \nASE theory encourages counselors to view each adolescent as actively shaping and being shaped \nby their environment. In practice, this means facilitating discussions that help students explore \nand define their identity, while also considering how factors like culture, peer influence, and \nschool dynamics impact their sense of self. Through ASE\u2019s student-centered approach, school \ncounselors help students build a sanguine, self-aware identity that supports both their social and \nacademic well-being.\nFor many adolescents, individual development requires someone who servs as \nan advocate for systemic support and change. ASE theory holds that adolescents are embedded \nwithin broader systems that can either support or hinder their growth. Recognizing this, school \ncounselors are encouraged to advocate not only for individual students but also for systemic \nchanges that promote inclusive and benefiting environments. For example, counselors might \nidentify patterns of stress or exclusion experienced by certain groups of students, such as those \nfrom marginalized backgrounds, and advocate for school-wide interventions, like inclusive \npolicies or culturally responsive teaching. In practice, this might also involve consulting and \ncollaborating with teachers, administrators, and families to create supportive networks that \naddress specific needs and foster resilience.\n\nA key practical consideration in this theory is the importance of cultural competence and \nsensitivity. Adolescents come from diverse backgrounds, and ASE theory emphasizes that \ncounselors must understand and respect these unique cultural contexts to support students \neffectively. Counselors can apply cultural competence by creating a safe, nonevaluative space \nwhere students feel validated and respected for who they are. For example, counselors might \nincorporate culturally relevant materials, practices, and examples into their work with students to \nfoster inclusivity and trust. By approaching each student\u2019s cultural background as an integral part \nof their identity, counselors can help adolescents feel seen and supported, which is essential for \neffective counseling relationships.\nFinally, ASE theory highlights the importance of developing self-regulation and \nexecutive functioning skills intended to promote adolescent growth. These skills are crucial for \nnavigating the demands of adolescence, from academic responsibilities to social challenges. In \npractice, counselors can work with students on goal-setting, time management, emotional \nregulation, and decision-making. The type of self-regulation endorsed by ASE theory is not to be \nconfused with requiring compliance in the student; instead, these regulatory and executive \ncontrol skills are intended to sharpen the innate capacities of adolescents so that they can be their \nown best arbitrators of their social positionality and life pursuits. By equipping adolescents with \nstrategies to manage their emotions, organize tasks, and solve problems effectively, counselors \nnot only support their immediate academic success but also build long-term resilience. The focus \non self-regulation aligns with ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on fostering students\u2019 ability to thrive \nwithin complex environments, ultimately preparing them for future challenges and opportunities.\nASE and the Fitness to Adults Affiliated with Middle and High Schools \n\nIn ASE theory, teachers, school administrators, parents and guardians, community \nmembers, and policy makers are seen as integral components of the student\u2019s broader \nenvironment, acting as both participants and potential advocates who directly influence students' \nacademic, social, and emotional development. Rather than viewing teachers and administrators \nsolely as facilitators of instruction or enforcers of school policies, ASE theory emphasizes their \nroles as active participants in creating a supportive, responsive, and inclusive school culture. This \norientation recognizes that teachers and administrators have a profound impact on shaping the \nschool environment, thus placing them in key positions to advocate for students, address their \nunique needs, and foster a culture that supports holistic development.\nIn practice, a school counselor who adopts ASE theory will deliver direct interventions to \nyouth in various school settings, and at the same time expose relevant adults to the content of \nthese interventions in appropriate, ethical, and student-centered ways. This approach is intended \nto establish reflexivity between students and members of the school context. Capacity \ndevelopment by the student requires awareness, reinforcement, and value at the systems level to \npersist and grow beyond the aspirations of the original counseling intervention. \nWith this orientation, school counselors work with educators and other adults to foster \nnurturing relationships and promote classroom environments that are inclusive and responsive to \ndiverse student needs. ASE theory encourages all adults to view themselves as advocates who \nunderstand the complexities of each student\u2019s environment, both within and outside of school. \nThis approach might involve adopting culturally responsive teaching practices, differentiating \ninstruction to cater to varied learning needs, or fostering an open and respectful classroom where \nstudents feel safe to express themselves. When school professionals see themselves as advocates \n\nfor their students, they play an active role in helping students develop confidence, resilience, and \na strong sense of belonging, all of which are essential for academic and social success. \nThe 3C + 5C = 2C Framework for ASE Theory\nAs a theory to inform the practice of counseling youth and the people who influence their \nschooling experiences, ASE includes features to accomplish the following: 1) assist how a school \ncounselor might conceptualize the individual student and the school as a dynamic system \nembedded within a larger sociocultural context; 2) inspire values and behaviors that are germane \nto individual student development and systemic transformation; and 3) posit a flexible and \nadaptive outcome that is considerate of and desirable to the diverse and changing needs of \nstudents and school systems. To this end, ASE theory employs the 3C + 5C = 2C framework, \nwhich was conceived to exhibit how school counselors can work in a theoretically intentional \nmanner that is germane to various types of students, events, and learning contexts.    \nFigure 1\nASE Conceptual Map\nASE 3C & 5C = 5C Framework\nHeritable/ \nOriginating\nCounseling Practice Priorities\n&\nStudent Experiences/Development\nIntentional/ \nEmerging\nHeritable/ \nEmerging\nCulture\nCuriosity\nCo-\nRegulation\nCuriosity\nCommunity\nCulture\nConstitution\nConnectednes\ns\nConnectednes\ns\nCompositio\nn\nConstitution\nCircumstanc\ne\nCompassion\nCompassion\nCircumstanc\ne\nContribution\nContribution\n3Cs for Conceptualization \nHuman development is generally dictated by various prior governors of experience, \nwhich include various factors established before and during one\u2019s upbringing and persist \nthroughout one\u2019s lifespan. These governors include the biological, familial, cultural, \nsocioeconomic ingredients shape a child\u2019s environment and experiences from an early age. In \n\norder to conceptualize the profundity of factors that make up students, educators, and other \nschool related persons, ASE-informed school counselors consider the assorted aspects of culture, \nconstitution, and circumstance for all people that they support in schools, with awareness of the \nintersectional nature of these factors.  \nThese cultural, constitutional, and circumstantial features are dynamic and ever-changing \naspects of experience. Just as the colored crystals in a kaleidoscope shifts to create new and \ncomplex patterns with every turn, a person\u2019s life is continually shaped by shifting interactions \nbetween personal, social, academic, and systemic factors. ASE theory emphasizes that \ncounselors must consider these constantly evolving patterns to fully understand each student\u2019s \nneeds and challenges. The ASE kaleidoscope metaphor underscores the importance of seeing \nstudents as multi-dimensional individuals, whose development and well-being are influenced by \na complex and fluctuating blend of internal and external elements. This perspective encourages \ncounselors to approach each student holistically and adaptively, recognizing the fluidity of their \nexperiences within the larger school and societal environments.\nCulture \nCulture plays a vital role in understanding the diverse backgrounds and experiences that \nshape students\u2019 identities and interactions within the educational environment. Culture \nencompasses the beliefs, values, customs, and social norms that influence how individuals \nperceive themselves and their place in the world (Lehman, et al., 2004). By acknowledging the \nimportance of culture, counselors and educators can develop a more nuanced understanding of \nthe factors that impact students\u2019 behaviors, motivations, and academic outcomes. This cultural \nawareness allows for the creation of more inclusive and responsive educational environments \nthat celebrate diversity and empower all students.\n\nAlongside personal culture, school culture is understood as a dynamic and complex \nenvironment that encompasses the values, norms, relationships, and practices shaping students' \ndaily experiences and development. The ASE theory emphasizes that school culture is not static; \nrather, it is continually evolving as students, teachers, staff, counselors, and administrators \ninteract and influence one another. This orientation sees school culture as a powerful determinant \nof student well-being, academic engagement, and social-emotional growth, recognizing that a \npositive, warm, and inclusive school culture can be a protective factor for students facing various \nchallenges. ASE theory encourages a holistic view of school culture, seeing it as a system that \nshould actively support each student's development within a web of social, emotional, and \nacademic contexts.\nWithin this theory, culture is not seen as an inert force, rather it includes and fosters the \nmultiple aspects of human experience that impact all people and systems in an ongoing manner. \nSchool counselors can work with students to explore and navigate the cultural influences that \nshape their experiences and choices. By acknowledging how students are affected by their \nmultiple intersecting cultures, school counselors can empower them to critically assess which \ninfluences are helpful and which may be detrimental to their well-being. For instance, if a \nstudent feels pressure to meet high family expectations that contribute to stress, a school \ncounselor might work with them to balance these expectations with their own goals and needs. \nThis process helps students build self-awareness and agency, as they learn to identify and \nmanage external influences in a way that supports their growth.  Understanding culture as a set \nof powerful influences that can be challenged encourages students to become active participants \nin their own development, giving them the tools to make decisions that align with their values \nand personal aspirations.\n\nUtilizing culture in the ASE framework involves recognizing and valuing the varied and \ndistinct backgrounds of students and educators as foundations for building strong, supportive \nrelationships. School counselors work with students and educators to explore their complex \ncultural identities, which includes helping them articulate their unique experiences and \nperspectives. This exploration fosters self-awareness and confidence, allowing students to \nconnect their cultural backgrounds to their academic and social lives in and beyond the school \ncontext. For instance, a counselor might incorporate culturally relevant materials and practices \ninto their small group counseling sessions, creating an environment where students feel seen and \nvalidated. By honoring cultural identities, counselors help students develop a positive sense of \nself and belonging, which is essential for academic success and emotional well-being.\nFurthermore, an ASE-oriented approach to school culture advocates for empowering \nstudents and educators (and family members) by actively including them in decision-making \nprocesses and fostering agency within the school system. School counselors advocate for the \ncreation and maintenance of activities where students have a voice in shaping school policies, \npractices, and events. This participatory approach gives students a sense of ownership over their \nschool experience, helping them develop leadership skills and a commitment to the well-being of \ntheir community. In an ASE-informed culture, students are seen as active contributors rather than \npassive recipients of the school environment. This inclusive, student-centered culture fosters \nadaptability and confidence, supporting students as they develop personally, socially, and \nacademically.\nFinally, school counselors and school leaders advocate for policies that support cultural \ndiversity and equity within the school system. This includes establishing partnerships with \nfamilies and community organizations to enhance cultural competence and awareness. Engaging \n\nwith families from diverse backgrounds can provide valuable insights into the specific needs and \nchallenges faced by students, allowing for more targeted support and resources. Furthermore, \nschools can promote events and initiatives that celebrate cultural diversity, fostering a sense of \ncommunity and belonging among students and families. By integrating culture into the ASE \nframework, school counselors and other educational professionals can create a learning \nenvironment that not only supports individual students but also transforms educational systems \nto be more equitable, inclusive, and responsive to the rich diversity of the student body.\nConstitution \nIf one\u2019s culture is the sum of one\u2019s ecological determinants of experience, then \nconstitution is the amalgamation of the complex, multi-dimensional interplay of internal factors \n(such as personality traits, emotional well-being, and cognitive or physical abilities) and social \ninfluences (including family dynamics, cultural background, and school environment). This \norientation emphasizes that students cannot be understood in isolation; rather, they exist within a \nweb of relationships and contexts that significantly influences their experiences and growth. By \nviewing students and educators holistically, ASE theory recognizes the uniqueness of each \nindividual and the importance of considering their personal narratives, strengths, and challenges \nas developing people.\nThis student-centered orientation can be utilized to support student development by \npromoting personalized approaches to education and counseling. School counselors work closely \nwith students to understand their individual needs, aspirations, and circumstances. For instance, \nby conducting assessments that explore a student\u2019s interests, motivations, and challenges, \ncounselors can tailor interventions that resonate with the student\u2019s personal context. This might \ninvolve creating individualized learning plans, facilitating goal-setting exercises, or \n\nimplementing mentorship programs that connect students with role models who reflect their \nbackgrounds and aspirations. By recognizing the individuality of each student, school counselors \ncan foster an environment that nurtures personal growth, adaptability and responsiveness, and \nself-efficacy, ultimately helping students pursue their potential.\nMoreover, the individual student orientation within ASE theory encourages schools to \nadopt a more inclusive and responsive approach to educational practices and policies. Schools \ncan implement systems that prioritize student voice and agency, allowing students to actively \nparticipate in shaping their educational experiences. This might include initiatives such as \nstudent led groups, feedback surveys, or participatory decision-making processes that empower \nstudents to express their ideas and concerns. By valuing students\u2019 perspectives and involving \nthem in the decision-making process, schools can create a culture of collaboration and respect \nthat honors each student\u2019s individuality and contributions. This shift toward inclusivity not only \nsupports student development but also enhances the overall school environment, making it more \nengaging and responsive to the needs of all students.\nCircumstance \nWhile culture and one\u2019s constitution are profoundly influential one one\u2019s experience in \nand beyond a school environment, neither individually nor together do they dictate total \nexperience. Circumstance describes the immediate, changeable conditions influencing a person\u2019s \ncurrent situation; while culture includes persistent shared values and norms, and one\u2019s \nconstitution is define as dynamic yet continuous individual, intrinsic qualities. Together, these \nelements interact to create a nuanced understanding of a person\u2019s needs and behaviors in ASE \ntheory. The emphasis on circumstance is essential because it highlights that students\u2019 or \neducators\u2019 behaviors and challenges are often responses to the conditions that influence \n\nexperience and behavior. For example, a student experiencing academic difficulty may be \nimpacted by stressors such as family instability, financial hardship, or social pressures. By \nconsidering these circumstances, counselors can identify the root causes of issues rather than \nfocusing solely on surface behaviors or symptoms. This perspective allows school counselors \nand other school allies to respond with targeted interventions that address the underlying needs \nof students, ultimately leading to more lasting and meaningful change.\nAdditionally, ASE\u2019s focus on circumstance empowers school counselors and educators to \nadvocate for systemic changes that support all students within their specific contexts. Since \nstudents\u2019 circumstances can often reveal inequities or barriers within the school environment, \nsuch as limited access to resources, cultural biases, or inflexible policies, this awareness enables \nschool staff to address and modify these systemic factors. For example, if certain students are \ndisproportionately affected by disciplinary practices, counselors can work to implement \nrestorative approaches that consider each student\u2019s unique situation. By addressing these \nsystemic barriers, ASE theory helps create a more equitable school environment that adapts to \nthe diverse circumstances of all students.\nLastly, the importance of circumstance in ASE theory aligns with the goal of fostering \nadaptability. By understanding and validating students\u2019 lived experiences, school counselors can \nhelp them develop coping strategies and skills that enable them to navigate their circumstances \neffectively. This might involve teaching self-regulation techniques, helping students connect with \nsupport networks, or developing personalized plans that respect each student\u2019s unique needs. \nEmphasizing circumstance not only allows for a more compassionate approach but also \nempowers students to understand and respond to the factors shaping their lives, ultimately \nsupporting their growth and resilience within a complex world.\n\n5Cs as School Counseling Values and Behaviors \nDrawing from the kaleidoscopic metaphor intended to illustrate the various governors of \nexperience, the ASE informed school counselor commits to certain values and practice behaviors \nintended to inspire new and more prosperous outcomes for persons and systems. This \ndevelopmental process recognizes that change is not linear; rather, it involves a complex \ninterplay between individual factors\u2014such as emotions, thoughts, and behaviors\u2014and \nenvironmental influences like social dynamics, school culture, and family systems. Inspired by \nVygotsky (1978) who posited that, \u201cthe method is simultaneously prerequisite and product, the \ntool and the result of the study\u201d (p.65), the ASE informed school counselor will adopt five \npractice values that anticipate five related capacities that might be refined and matured in \nstudents and educators.  These five values and practices include curiosity, connection, co-\nregulation, compassion, and contribution, abbreviately known as the 5Cs.    \nEach of the 5Cs are aimed at the establishment of a strong, trusting relationship between \nthe counselor and the student or educator. This relationship serves as a foundational element that \nfosters openness and vulnerability, enabling recipients to explore their thoughts and feelings in a \nsafe space. School counselors can utilize active listening, empathy, and validation to create an \nenvironment where students feel comfortable discussing their challenges and aspirations. \nUltimately, the therapeutic change process within ASE theory highlights the interconnectedness \nof individual growth and environmental factors, emphasizing a holistic approach to student well-\nbeing and success.\nCuriosity\nCentral to ASE is the understanding that school counselors must advocate for the student \nnot in isolation, but as part of a larger ecological system that includes external influences and \n\nsupports. As a value for school counselors to embody, curiosity encourages school counselors to \nbroach each student without presumption, exploring the unique environmental factors that \ncontribute to the student\u2019s challenges and strengths. Through this lens, curiosity becomes a \npathway for gaining deeper insight into the student\u2019s background, culture, and personal \nexperiences, fostering an empathetic understanding that can lead to more personalized support \nand advocacy.\nAs a counseling outcome that can be experienced by students, educators, or other school \npertinent individuals, curiosity is understood as sapience.  Sapience is wisdom and capacity for \ndeep understanding that one develops as they learn to navigate and make sense of their \nexperiences within various social, academic, and personal contexts. Sapience, in this context, \ngoes beyond simple knowledge acquisition\u2014it involves insight, discernment, and the ability to \nmake thoughtful decisions that reflect an awareness of both internal values and external \ninfluences. ASE theory emphasizes that fostering sapience equips recipients with the tools \nneeded to critically analyze their environments and make decisions that align with their well-\nbeing and long-term goals. Furthermore, as a value and outcome, curiosity suggests that there is \na discernable lived experience that is veritable and reasonable and, yet, at the same time there are \nvarious interpretations and perspectives to consider for deeper sapience.  \nCuriosity as a practice behavior suggests that school counselors encourage sapience by \nguiding individuals in reflective practices that foster self-awareness, critical thinking, and ethical \ndecision-making. School counselors can also use curiosity to facilitate a safe space where \nstudents feel understood and valued. When school counselors display genuine curiosity about \nstudents\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and experiences, they signal openness and respect, encouraging \nstudents to share more authentically. This curiosity-driven approach helps build trust, making it \n\neasier for students to explore their struggles and aspirations. By asking open-ended questions and \nactively listening to responses, school counselors validate students' perspectives and empower \nthem to become more introspective. In practice, curiosity might lead school counselor to inquire \nnot only about students' academic performance but also about their peer relationships, family \ndynamics, and emotional well-being, forming a more complete picture that can guide \ninterventions and support strategies.\nCuriosity within ASE harkens to the 3Cs that the school counselor or student utilizes to \nconceptualize the various prior determinants of experiences. Prior determinants are not \nnecessarily fixed causal ingredients, rather they are conceived as contributory governors (assets) \nor detracting governors (impediments), that influence experience rather than wholly dictate it.  \nGovernors can include a range of social, cultural, and institutional influences\u2014such as family \nexpectations, peer dynamics, cultural norms, and school policies\u2014that shape the way students \nperceive themselves and interact with their surroundings. When school counselors and students \nconsider the influence of governors, they can used to explore and navigate the influences that \nshape experiences and choices. By acknowledging how these external factors affect students, \neducators, and other social forces affecting schools, counselors can empower individuals to \ncritically assess which influences are helpful and which may be detrimental to school climate and \nwell-being. \nConnectedness\nA prerequisite value and practice behavior to enact curiosity is to establish connectedness \nbetween oneself and others. When one experiences connectedness, they generally feel safe, \nvalued, and purposeful. From an ASE lens, connectedness can be a powerful strategy to support \nstudents holistically within their unique environments. ASE theory emphasizes that a student\u2019s \n\nchallenges and strengths are shaped by their broader social contexts, which include relationships \nwith peers, family members, teachers, and the school system itself. Counselors focusing on \nconnectedness can foster meaningful relationships with students, creating a supportive space \nwhere students feel valued and understood. By building these genuine connections, counselors \nhelp students develop a stronger sense of belonging, which research consistently links to \nimproved mental health, academic performance, and resilience. Through intentional \nconnectedness, counselors validate students\u2019 experiences, encouraging them to actively engage \nwith their school environment and to feel more supported within it.\nConnectedness also encourages students to develop healthy interpersonal skills and \nrelationships within the school environment. When school counselors\u2019 model and emphasize the \nimportance of empathy, active listening, and trust, students learn to cultivate these qualities in \ntheir relationships with peers, teachers, and family. This approach not only reinforces students' \nsocial skills but also fosters a greater sense of community and shared responsibility within the \nschool. By feeling connected, students are more likely to engage positively in school activities, \nseek out help when needed, and build a network of support. For example, a school counselor \nmay facilitate peer support groups or mentor programs that connect students with similar \ninterests or challenges, providing both relational support and a sense of community that extends \nbeyond the counseling office.\nFor school counselors, fostering connectedness goes beyond individual relationships and \nincludes building bridges within the broader school system. School counselors can act as liaisons \nbetween students, teachers, and administrators, facilitating open communication and a sense of \nunity within the school environment. This can involve collaborating with teachers to address \nstudent needs, working with administrators to create inclusive policies, and fostering \n\nrelationships with families to ensure students receive consistent support across home and school \nsettings. By connecting various stakeholders in the student\u2019s life, counselors create a web of \nsupport that reinforces the student\u2019s growth and well-being, aligning resources and efforts to \ncreate a nurturing environment. ASE-driven connectedness, therefore, benefits not only \nindividual students but also strengthens the school community as a whole, making it more \ninclusive and responsive.\nFurthermore, connectedness allows counselors to advocate for systemic change in ways \nthat prioritize inclusivity and equity within the school environment. By understanding students\u2019 \nexperiences and connecting with them on a personal level, school counselors can identify \npatterns of inequity that may affect certain groups. Through these insights, counselors can work \nto promote systemic reforms\u2014such as culturally responsive curricula or accessible mental health \nresources\u2014that address these inequities and support all students. When school counselors \nengage with both students and school systems in this way, they ensure that their advocacy efforts \nare informed by real, human experiences, creating a sense of collective responsibility and shared \npurpose within the school. Connectedness, therefore, becomes a foundational aspect of advocacy \nunder ASE, as it empowers school counselors to create supportive environments that reflect the \nneeds and voices of every student.\nCo-regulation\nCo-regulation is when two or more self-aware, intentional individuals draw from various \ncultural, social, and personal sources to inform and influence behavior (McCaslin, 2009). As a \nvalue and practice behavior for school counselors inspired by ASE theory, co-regulation \ncontributes to students\u2019 emotional and behavioral needs by acting as calm, supportive figures \nwithin the school setting. Co-regulation involves a school counselor\u2019s ability to help students \n\nmanage their emotions and stress by providing a stable, empathetic presence. ASE theory views \nstudents within their broader environmental contexts, understanding that external pressures from \nhome, peers, and school can significantly impact a student\u2019s ability to self-regulate. By enticing \nmutual co-regulation, school counselors help students develop the skills needed to navigate \nchallenging emotions, especially those stemming from environmental stressors. \nCo-regulation in ASE is associated with the concept of allostasis (Sterling, 2012), which \npertains to the various predictive regulation strategies pulled from a person\u2019s prior experiences \n(i.e., cognitive, emotional, behavioral, cultural) and used to establish ongoing personal and social \nadaptability in response emergent events or environments. ASE theory acknowledges that \nstudents\u2019 challenges are often influenced by environmental factors, making stress a significant \ncomponent of their day-to-day experiences. School counselors who use an allostasis-based \napproach help students understand and manage stress effectively by teaching adaptive strategies \nthat enable them to achieve balance in the face of academic, social, and personal pressures. The \nfocus on allostasis is different than the pursuance of homeostasis; consistent with ASE theory, \nthe goal is not to inspire compliance or conformity in schools, rather the intent is to support \nstudents\u2019 volitional capacities for self-definition and social transformation.  This sentiment is \nbest articulated in the following quote from the ASE related literature: \n\u201cTo best prepare young children in poverty for later life challenges, professional \ncounselors must make every attempt to improve social conditions; however, it is equally \nimportant that young children\u2019s internal capacities be strengthened either to accommodate \nimproved social conditions or to maximize resilience in the face of persistent adversity\u201d \n(Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2018, p. 299). \nCo-regulation can be established when students feel comfortable expressing their feelings \nand vulnerabilities. In a co-regulatory relationship, the school counselor\u2019s calm and empathetic \ndemeanor helps reduce a student\u2019s stress and anxiety, allowing the student to feel seen and \n\nunderstood. By listening actively and validating students' emotions, school counselors help them \nunderstand that their feelings are both acknowledged and manageable. This fosters trust and \nsecurity, which encourages students to be open about their struggles and seek support as needed. \nFor instance, a school counselor might notice a student displaying heightened anxiety or \nfrustration and respond by engaging in calming activities, deep breathing, or grounding \ntechniques, allowing the student to experience a calming influence in real time. This co-\nregulation practice not only addresses immediate emotional needs but also teaches students \nvaluable strategies for future allostasis.\nBeyond individual interactions, co-regulation can also extend to support the broader \nschool environment by influencing the ways teachers and staff approach student interactions. \nSchool counselors trained in ASE can model co-regulatory techniques in their collaborations \nwith teachers and staff, encouraging them to adopt similar calming, supportive approaches with \nstudents. This may include training sessions on emotional de-escalation, providing resources on \nmanaging challenging classroom behaviors, and promoting empathetic communication with \nstudents. Recognizing that stress often arises from systemic issues like academic pressures, \ninequitable access to resources, or family challenges, ASE-informed school counselors can work \nwith school leaders to make structural changes that benefit student well-being. This might \ninclude advocating for learning accommodations, promoting equitable access to mental health \nresources, or implementing trauma-informed practices that support students facing adversity. \nThe concept of co-regulation further illustrates the challenges implicit to personal and \nsocial change. Even if a student amplifies their initiative and abilities, without parallel \npreparedness for development in the school environment there is little incentive and support to \nmaintain or continue development at the individual student level.  This is the central dictum of \n\nASE theory, sustaining and impactful change must be shared between the student and relevant \naspects of the school environment, or it is unlikely that development will sustain nonetheless \nflourish and adapt continuously throughout the lifespan.    \nCompassion\nThe prefix \u201ccom\u201d reflects the central value and practice of ASE theory, namely that all \nrelationships exist within contexts. Passion alludes to the ontological being for students and \neducators (biological, psychological, cultural) to exist in a school, in their given role, and in \nrelationship with the various environments in their spheres. Considered together, from an ASE \nperspective, compassion is the value and practice of personal and social acceptance with \ndiscernment. From an ASE perspective, this version of compassion is articulated in the following \nquote: \nCounselors who use SEL [sic; i.e., social and emotional learning] and MBI [sic; i.e., \nmindfulness-based intervention] activities do not assuage students, especially those who \nhave experienced personal or social harm. Instead, mindfulness-based nonjudgment, for \nexample, refers to students\u2019 experiential discernment and the inclination to suspend \npernicious identification or evaluation of these experiences. Stated otherwise, students \nfrom disenfranchised communities do not accept inadequate or deleterious social \nconditions; instead, using social\u2013emotional and mindfulness strategies, they accept their \ncognitive and affective reactions and respond with clearer intentionality. (Lemberger-\nTruelove et al., 2018, p. 299)\nCompassion suggests that being (as student, as educator, or as parent) results in a complex self \nwho is tethered to various competing systems and influences.  Therefore, compassion is the \npractice of discerning prior causes and effects of experience in a benevolent and focused way \nthat is protective of one\u2019s wellbeing and ongoing development. \n  ASE emphasizes that students' struggles often stem from external factors like family \nchallenges, peer pressure, or systemic inequities, which means effective support requires a deep \nunderstanding of these influences. When school counselors approach students with compassion, \n\nthey acknowledge and validate these contextual influences, showing empathy and kindness that \nfosters a safe and trusting relationship. Compassion-driven counseling and education under ASE \nallows students to feel accepted and understood in a non-judgmental space, encouraging them to \nexpress their true selves and explore solutions collaboratively.\nCompassion also empowers counselors to provide tailored support that considers each \nstudent\u2019s unique experiences and needs. By listening intently and responding empathetically, \ncounselors can identify not only the issues a student faces but also the strengths and resilience \nthey possess. This compassionate approach enables school counselors to help students see their \nown worth and capabilities, encouraging self-compassion and self-acceptance. For example, if a \nstudent is struggling with self-concept due to academic pressures, a compassionate counselor \nmight help them reframe their challenges as opportunities for growth, emphasizing that their \nvalue isn\u2019t solely tied to academic achievements. This kind of compassion-centered guidance is \nparticularly powerful for students who may feel marginalized or misunderstood within their \nenvironments, as it provides them with a counter-narrative of acceptance and support.\nIn addition to supporting individual students, compassion as a technique can influence the \nbroader school system by shaping the way teachers, staff, and administrators engage with \nstudents. ASE-aligned school counselors can model compassionate practices and offer training or \nresources that encourage staff to adopt a compassionate, student-centered approach in their daily \ninteractions. For instance, a school counselor might advocate for restorative disciplinary \npractices over punitive measures, showing how compassionate approaches reduce negative \noutcomes and support students' emotional and social growth. By promoting compassion at a \nsystemic level, school counselors help build a school culture where empathy and understanding \nare prioritized, creating a more supportive and inclusive environment that benefits all students.\n\nCompassion-driven advocacy within the ASE framework enables school counselors to \npursue systemic changes that address inequities impacting student well-being. Recognizing the \nbarriers some students face\u2014such as discrimination, limited resources, or social \nstigma\u2014compassionate counselors actively work to create a more equitable school environment. \nThey may advocate for policies that ensure equal access to mental health support, inclusive \ncurricula, or additional resources for underserved students. Through this compassionate \nadvocacy, counselors become powerful allies in creating a school system that recognizes and \nresponds to students\u2019 needs holistically. Compassion, as used in ASE, thus extends beyond \nindividual interactions to influence the school environment itself, fostering a culture where \nstudents feel supported, valued, and understood.\nContribution\nAs an approach intended to cultivate individual agency and pursue social transformation, \nit is essential that ASE theory includes formal values and counseling activities that inspire overt \nbehavioral expressions.  The final C of contribution suggests that the school counselor join with \nstudents and educators to enact tangible behaviors that result in personal and systemic \ndevelopment.  As a value, contribution represents a commitment to mutual acts of solidarity and \nresponsivity.  As a counseling technique, contribution is a material way to encourage purpose \nand belonging within their school communities. ASE emphasizes understanding and supporting \nstudents within the context of their environments, which includes their connections to peers, \nfamily, school, and society. By encouraging students to make meaningful \ncontributions\u2014whether through helping others, participating in projects, or engaging in \nextracurricular activities\u2014counselors can help students feel more connected to their \nenvironments and recognize the positive impact they can have. This sense of purpose fosters \n\nself-worth and social agency, as students see themselves as valuable members of their school \ncommunity, capable of making a difference.\nThrough contribution, school counselors can also help students develop important social-\nemotional skills such as empathy, teamwork, and responsibility. By encouraging students to \nparticipate in group activities, community service, or peer support programs, counselors create \nopportunities for them to practice these skills in real-life settings. For example, a school \ncounselor might suggest that a student struggling with self-confidence join a mentorship program \nwhere they can help younger students with academic or social challenges. This opportunity to \ncontribute to others helps students shift their focus outward, building empathy and connection \nwhile reinforcing their own strengths and abilities. In this way, contribution fosters both personal \ngrowth and social connectedness, supporting ASE\u2019s focus on students\u2019 development within their \nbroader social environments.\nContribution as a counseling technique also extends to shaping a positive school climate. \nSchool counselors can work with teachers, administrators, and student leaders to create programs \nand initiatives that allow students to actively engage in and contribute to their school \nenvironment. Activities like organizing school events, participating in student-led committees, or \ncontributing to a school beautification project empower students to take ownership of their \nschool community, cultivating pride and a sense of belonging. By facilitating these opportunities, \ncounselors help create a school culture where all students feel that their input is valued and that \nthey play a meaningful role in shaping their school. This approach aligns with ASE's emphasis \non advocacy and creating supportive environments that encourage student agency.\n2Cs that School Counselors Pursue\n\nThe ASE approach to school counseling is generally concerned with providing students \nand other participants in school systems with opportunities to develop and thrive in ways that are \nnot fully dictated by prior determinants of experience. Although there is no predetermined- or \nideal-self assumed in ASE theory, there is some proto version of the person that can emerge if \nconsistently engaged in supportive conditions for development. As such, the final 2Cs in the \nASE framework illustrates how personal (i.e., composition) and environmental (i.e., community) \noutcomes can vary and evolve across individuals and conditions.   \nComposition\nIn ASE theory, the composition of one\u2019s personal character is viewed as a dynamic, \nholistic expression of personal wellness that arises through the nurturing of curiosity, \nconnectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution. This is related to and yet different \nfrom one\u2019s constitution, which is personal and yet almost fully inherited outside of the conscious \ncontrol of the person. To illustrate this distinction, the etymology of constitution comes from the \nLatin constitutus, which means \"set up\" or \"established\" whereas composition in Latin (i.e., \ncomponere) is translated as \u201cput together.\u201d Therefore, it is critical that the school counselor \ndifferentiate the inherited constitution from one\u2019s composition, which is emergent from various \ncomplex governors experienced throughout development.   \nComposition highlights the integration of internal strengths and external supports, \nframing development as a collaborative and fluid process rather than a static acquisition of traits. \nIn this manner, ASE theory avoids the individualistic and potentially deficit-oriented lens of \ntraditional character education. This approach emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and \nadvocacy, ensuring that students are supported as whole individuals rather than being judged by \nnarrow or universal standards of \"character.\"\n\nASE theory suggests that wellness is not just an individual achievement but an outcome \nof constructive interactions within one's social environment. Through this lens, character \nformation is seen as a continuous process, shaped by the student\u2019s internal attributes and \ninteractions with peers, teachers, family, and community.  Leading with curiosity, connectedness, \nco-regulation, compassion, and contribution as guiding elements of practice, school counselors \nhelp the student develop a well-rounded personage that is capable, socially aware, and actively \nengaged in personal, academic, and vocational growth. \nCommunity \nFor ASE theory, community is defined as a dynamic and emergent network of \nrelationships and interactions that shape students\u2019 experiences and contribute to their \ndevelopment. Community in ASE theory goes beyond the physical or geographic boundaries of a \nschool; it includes the social, emotional, cultural, and academic connections that exist between \nstudents, educators, families, and the broader societal context. This perspective views \ncommunity as a supportive system that actively influences and is influenced by each member, \nreflecting the theory\u2019s emphasis on the interplay between individual students and their \nenvironments.\nIf culture includes the total of one\u2019s inherited social influences, then community are those \nsocial experiences that are crafted. The distinction is important because while culture may exert \npassive or unexamined influence over a student\u2019s environment, community is largely an \nintentional, actionable process that allows for agency and transformation.  \nCommunity in ASE theory is foundational to fostering a sense of belonging and \ncollective responsibility. Students thrive when they feel connected to a larger supportive \nnetwork, which enhances their engagement, motivation, and emotional well-being. The school is \n\nseen as a central hub within the community, one that brings together diverse individuals who \neach contribute to an inclusive, respectful, and empathetic environment. At the individual student \nor educator level, community is understood as endogenous, that is the within aspect of student-\nwithin-environment. School counselors who apply the concept of endogenous can work with \nstudents to identify and develop their internal strengths, such as self-confidence, self-efficacy, \nand resilience. By focusing on these qualities, counselors help students cultivate a strong sense of \nself-in-environment that enables them to handle academic pressures, social challenges, and \npersonal setbacks. By fostering personal and social connections, ASE theory emphasizes the \nimportance of community as a protective factor, especially for students who may feel isolated or \nface challenges in their personal lives.\nASE as an Evidence-Supported Approach to School Counseling \nIn a content analysis study that included all school counseling intervention studies \npublished in counseling journals from 2003 to 2022, ASE theory was the most used school \ncounseling theory in those school counselor-led intervention studies (Kim et al., 2024).  \nExamples of ASE trials performed in K12 schools highlight gains in areas such as students\u2019 \nexecutive functioning, feelings of connectedness, curiosity, and academic achievement outcomes \non standardized reading, math, and science tests (Bowers et al., 2020; Ceballos et al., 2021; \nLemberger et al., 2018; Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2021). Across the ASE studies, the samples \ninclude ethnically and economically diverse students across various educational settings, \nspanning both rural and urban schools. Consistent with theory, scholars evaluated how educators \nwere affected by ASE interventions including outcomes that demonstrated improvements in \nteachers\u2019 stress management, mindfulness, and the quality of teacher\u2013student relationships \n(Molina et al., 2022). These results are particularly compelling given the misbelief that \n\nsecondary school counselors are limited in their capacity to deliver direct services in schools.  \nWhereas the theoretical language of ASE promises transformation, these emergent empirical \nresults demonstrate that when school counselors, students, and school-related adults commit to \ncreating more prosperous school environments, both students and educators benefit in ways that \nare personally and socially meaningful.  \nConclusion\nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory emphasizes the holistic \nunderstanding of students as individuals deeply embedded within a complex web of \nenvironmental influences. Students cannot be viewed in isolation; rather, their behaviors, \nemotions, and academic outcomes are shaped by the interplay of internal factors (such as \npersonality and cognitive processes) and external factors (including family, cultural context, and \nschool environment). This comprehensive perspective encourages educators and counselors to \nconsider the myriad influences that affect a student\u2019s life, ensuring that interventions and support \nsystems are tailored to meet each student\u2019s unique circumstances.\nA crucial aspect of ASE theory is the emphasis on advocacy. Counselors and educators \nare seen as advocates for students, working to promote their well-being within the school system \nand broader community. This advocacy involves not only supporting individual students but also \naddressing systemic barriers that may hinder their success. By recognizing the social and \nenvironmental factors that impact students, counselors can work collaboratively with families, \neducators, and community organizations to create supportive networks that empower students. \nThis commitment to advocacy ensures that students receive the resources and opportunities \nnecessary to thrive, fostering resilience and promoting a sense of agency in their own lives.\n\nReferences \nBowers, H., Lemberger-Truelove, M.

The school context and the roles and responsibilities associated with school counseling \nrequire unique theoretical assumptions and practice behaviors\n1.\nSchool counseling with an educator-counselor identity (non-dual); \u201cThe situatedness \nin schools compels all behaviors to be in service of the educational mission of the \nschool and in support of student needs as learners and social beings. Parallel to the \neducator identity, the term counselor in school counselor suggests a certain \norientation that is concerned with the delivery of services focused on prevention and \ndevelopment that anticipate a medley of wellness and social justice outcomes\u201d (Levy \n& Lemberger-Truelove, 2021, p. 1)\n2.\nThe philosophical bases of counseling (as distinct from other mental health and \neducation professions) pertains to the blend of prevention, development, wellness, \nand social justice\n3.\nThe qualities of a school context, the dispositional characteristics of students as \nsocial learners and teachers as professional educators, etc.. each suggests that \ncounseling interventions must be germane to the total features of the school as a \ndistinct context\n4.\nThe identity and advocacy of school counseling as a distinct and additive profession \ndemands nuanced beliefs, practices, and modes of evaluation \nB. ASE on Nature/Nurture & Epistemology:  Students, educators, and other school \nstakeholders are situated in school environments as co-determinants of experiences.  \n1.\nStudents (and educators) are always bound to their prior influences (e.g., biology, \nculture, spatiality) to varying degrees (see ASE kaleidoscope metaphor), although \none\u2019s personal experience and teleonomy is always dynamic based on a profound \nlatticework of exposures, social forces, and personal history and responses to \ncircumstance\n2.\nGiven co-determination as an epistemological stance, adherents of ASE theory \nbelieve that manifold prior influences (i.e., governors of experience) largely influence \ncurrent experiences and functioning, yet the individual (student, educator, family \nmember) is not completely inert or beneficiary of social forces. \n3.\nVolitional control is the manner that personal experience emerges uniquely out of \nthe prior co-determinants of experience; this is not a priori personal agency, but \nthrough more contributory personal aptitudes and social circumstances, students are \nmore liberated to experience and act intentionally and in solidarity with \nothers/ecology; experience is a co-determined emergence \n4.\nIn tandem with volitional control (as expressed through one\u2019s executive functioning \ntendencies), ASE is an approach to school counseling which focuses on impacting \nstudents and the environments they inhabit and circumstances they face through a \nsocial justice framework for lasting desirable development\n5.\nThe relationship between personal (liberated) volition and social justice is the \nstudent\u2019s (and educator\u2019s) critical consciousness (sapience), which is the \ndevelopmentally feasible and appropriate acumen to operate in one\u2019s ecology \n6.\nVarious school and broader ecological influences affect personal and schooling \nexperiences, therefore interventions performed by a school counselor must be \nreflexive \u2013 i.e., germane and effective in ameliorating both personal and social \ndevelopment \n\n7.\nThe 3-5-1 C\u2019s of ASE Theory\na)\n3 Cs \u2013 Ontological assumptions of students and school environments \n(assessment); prior determinants of experience \n(1) Constitution \u2013 \u201cthe aggregate of a person\u2019s physical and \npsychological characteristics\u201d \n(2) Culture \u2013 attitudes, values, and practices that characterize and \ninfluence institutions or groups of organisms  \n(3) Circumstance - a condition, fact, or event accompanying, \nconditioning, or determining another\nb) 5 Cs \u2013 Counseling practice priorities \n(1) Curiosity - includes qualities such as openness, reflexivity, tenacity, \nhumility, inquisitiveness, flexibility, emotional dexterity, and many \nother attributes necessary in affiliating prior states with emergent \nstates of being; \n(2) Connectedness - is the experience of acceptance, safety, \nencouragement, and respect shared between students, school \ncounselors, educators, or other school-related persons;\n(3) Co-regulation \u2013 is the interface of two or more self-aware, intentional \nindividuals who draw from various cultural, social, and personal \nsources to inform and influence behavior;\n(4) Compassion - is the orientation and practice of personal and social \nacceptance with discernment; compassion suggests that to endure the \ncomplexity of being a complex self who is tethered to various \ncompeting systems, discerning prior causes and effects of experience \nin a benevolent and focused way can protect one\u2019s wellbeing and \nbetter position oneself for future personal and social development; \nand\n(5) Contribution - is the co-regulated efforts to change social systems \nand personal commitments to social advocacy. \nc) 1 C \u2013 the aim of ASE (i.e., how the 3Cs are affected by the 5 Cs)\n(1) Community \u2013 people and systems with generally common interests, \nincluding contributory variation and evolution\nII. Assumptions of Wellness\nA. For adherents of ASE theory, wellness must occur at both the personal (student, educator) \nand social (school, culture) levels to be fully actualized; it is inappropriate and potentially \nharmful to suggest wellness is the sole responsibility of the most affected and least \nempowered members of social systems.  Similarly, it is potentially disarming and harmful to \nnot include these students as arbitrators of their own development and wellness; \nB. Reflexive and co-regulated development and wellness can inadvertently transmute into \nconsensus or complicity, which is not the intention of ASE; wellness is generative and \npersistently dynamic through self- and social-reflection and -evolution \nC. Wellness requires a profound and patient commitment to personal and social solidarity \nD. Wellness is not a fixed or presupposed state, even when affiliated with desirable school \noutcomes (e.g., academic achievement, desirable classroom behaviors); instead, wellness is \nonly concerned with the persistence of curious, co-regulated, connected, compassionate, and \ncontributory experiences and behaviors in and beyond the school environment \nIII. Assumptions of psychopathology and/or disturbance\n\nA. There are various forms of social and personal disturbances that threaten students (and \neducators) in schools, including forces that affect people from outside of the immediate \nschool context and influences from within the self-and/or school\nB. ASE is a strength-focused orientation, therefore potential threats are conceived as \nexperientially real; although they are veritable in the lived experience of the student or \neducator, how they are experienced is dimensional and dynamic \n1.\nEfforts to ameliorate personal or social governors is not to be confused with \ndiscounting or merely reframing concepts, rather conceiving of the governors \nthrough the 5 Cs, students and educators can operate on their determinants of \nexperience in more personally and socially meaningful and contributory ways \nIV. Therapeutic Change Process: \nA. ASE informed school counselors utilize the delivery systems typical of school counselors \n(e.g., classroom instruction, consultation, small group and individual counseling, indirect \nservices, systems advocacy), using manualized curriculum, spontaneous dialogue and \nbehaviors, advocacy at the systems level, etc.  \nB. ASE is concerned chiefly with the creation of the preconditions of well development, \nincluding cultivating individual (student, educator) capacity and ameliorating more just and \nfacilitative environments (school, community); counseling is a preventative and \ndevelopmental praxis\u00a0\nC. The counselor takes on a leadership role in part of a triad to create a well student and \nenvironment. The counselor should enter the students\u2019 inner world while considering their \nsocial circumstance and then empower the student to tap into their personal resources to \nnavigate various environments. \n1.\nStudents are able to engage more if they feel connected to school environment in \nsome capacity with peers and adults, thus school counselors can cultivate a shift in \nsafety and acceptance in their schools through various preventative and responsive \nservices programs. \n2.\nCounselor should also strive to evoke change in the school environment to allow for \ncontinued reinforcement of students\u2019 acquired skills. \n3.\nCounselor engages student dialogue and fosters students\u2019 ability to critically look at \ntheir dispositions and goals. As student learns new strategies, they can apply them to \nother contexts.  \n4.\nCounselor also provides preventative services to further facilitate the progression of \nstudents\u2019 abilities; reflexive interventions occur when students and educators are \nprovided complimentary interventions \nV. ASE and the pertinence to diverse students and school settings\nA. As an ecological approach to school counseling, ASE centers ideology and practice on \npersonal and cultural diversity, within students-as-individuals and schools-as-systems, and \neducation-as-sociopolitical structures\nB. Each student is conceived as a cultural and personal agent, with varying degrees of influence \nand expression\nC. Schools as systems are conceived as a reflection of broader sociocultural systems; \ninterventions and advocacy must be compliant to the culture of the school (broadly defined) \nand yet school counselors must persistently advocate for cultural refinement that lends to the \npersonal and social liberation of students \nVI. ASE and empirical studies\nA. ASE practitioners and scholars adopt a dialogical position on research \u2013 i.e., data is captured, \nanalyzed, and disseminated as symbolic, non-essentialized approximations of experience; \n\ndetailing what is possible rather than what is de-contextually probable; as such, school \ncounselors use data critically to advocate for the student and to challenge the most fruitful \npermutation of schooling systems \nB. The school counseling literature is limited in randomized controlled trials (i.e., less than .01% \nof the counseling literature [Griffith et al, 2019]), although ASE is the most researched \ntheory specific to school counseling (Kim et al., 2024) , including \n1.\nStudent outcomes associated with ASE interventions include development in \nexecutive functioning, feelings of connectedness, social curiosity, and achievement in \nreading, math, and science on standardized academic tests (Bowers et al., 2020; \nCeballos, et al., 2021; Lemberger et al., 2018; Lemberger-Truelove et al. 2021). \nTreatment outcomes include samples of ethnically and economically diverse \nstudents, ranging from PreK to high school settings in both rural and urban schools. \n2.\nFor teachers exposed to ASE interventions, results have demonstrated significant \nchanges in teachers\u2019 perceived stress, mindfulness, and teacher-student relationships \n(Lemberger-Truelove et al., in press; Molina et al., 2022). \n\nReferences\nBowers, H., Lemberger-Truelove, M.

The school context and the roles and responsibilities associated with school counseling require unique \ntheoretical assumptions and specific practice behaviors.\n1.\nSchool counseling is an educator-counselor identity that does not operate with dual roles; rather, it is \nsituated in schools where all actions serve the educational mission and support students' needs as \nlearners and social beings. Similar to the educator identity, the term \"counselor\" in \"school counselor\" \nimplies a focus on delivering preventative and developmental services aimed at wellness and social \njustice outcomes (Levy & Lemberger-Truelove, 2021, p. 1).\n2.\nThe philosophical foundations of counseling, distinct from other mental health and educational \nprofessions, emphasize prevention, development, wellness, and social justice as integral components.\n3.\nThe unique qualities of a school environment, along with the social learning characteristics of students \nand the professional responsibilities of teachers, imply that counseling interventions must be aligned \nwith the distinct features of the school context.\n4.\nThe identity and advocacy efforts of school counseling as a unique and contributing profession require \nspecific beliefs, practices, and evaluation methods to be effective.\nB. ASE Theory's Perspective on Nature/Nurture and Epistemology: Students, educators, and other \nstakeholders within the school environment are co-determinants of individual and shared experiences.\n1.\nStudents and educators are influenced by their biological, cultural, and spatial backgrounds, as illustrated \nin the ASE kaleidoscope metaphor. However, personal experience and purposeful behavior are \ndynamically shaped by a network of exposures, social forces, and personal history.\n2.\nThrough the co-deterministic epistemological stance of ASE theory, it is understood that multiple \nprevious influences, or \"governors of experience,\" significantly shape current functioning and \nexperience. However, individuals are not merely passive products of these forces.\n3.\nVolitional control represents how unique personal experience emerges from these prior co-\ndeterminants. Rather than simply being agency, it is through a mix of personal aptitudes and social \nenvironments that students gain the freedom to act intentionally and in solidarity with their \ncommunities. Experience is thus a co-determined emergence.\n4.\nAlongside volitional control, ASE positions school counseling as focused on positively impacting both \nstudents and their environments, using a social justice framework for long-term, beneficial development.\n5.\nThe relationship between personal volition and social justice manifests as critical consciousness, or \n\"sapience,\" allowing students and educators to operate insightfully within their environments.\n6.\nGiven the influence of school and broader ecological factors on personal and educational experiences, \nschool counselors must design interventions that are reflexive and relevant, addressing both personal \nand social development needs.\n7.\nThe 3-5-1 C\u2019s of ASE Theory:\na)\u00a03 Cs\u00a0\u2013 Ontological assumptions regarding students and school environments.\n(1) Constitution \u2013 The combination of an individual's physical and psychological traits.\n(2) Culture \u2013 The attitudes, values, and practices that characterize and shape institutions or groups.\n(3) Circumstance \u2013 A condition, fact, or event that accompanies, influences, or determines another.\nb)\u00a05 Cs\u00a0\u2013 Counseling practice priorities.\n(1) Curiosity \u2013 An openness, reflexivity, tenacity, humility, inquisitiveness, flexibility, and emotional adaptability \nnecessary to connect prior states with emerging identities.\n(2) Connectedness \u2013 An experience of acceptance, safety, encouragement, and mutual respect shared between \nstudents, counselors, and educators.\n(3) Co-regulation \u2013 The interaction between self-aware individuals drawing from various sources to shape and \ninfluence behavior.\n(4) Compassion \u2013 The capacity for discerning acceptance, understanding the complexity of self in relation to \ndiverse systems, fostering well-being and future growth.\n\n(5) Contribution \u2013 Co-regulated efforts to enact social change and individual commitments to advocacy.\nc)\u00a01 C\u00a0\u2013 The aim of ASE Theory.\n(1) Community \u2013 A network of people and systems sharing common interests, evolving and varying \ncontributively.\nII. Assumptions of Wellness\nA. According to ASE theory, wellness must occur at both the individual (student, educator) and social (school, \nculture) levels for true actualization. It is both inappropriate and potentially harmful to assume that \nwellness lies solely with the least empowered members of social systems. However, students must also \nhave an active role in shaping their development and wellness.\nB. Reflexive and co-regulated development in wellness should not transform into conformity, as ASE values \ndynamic, generative growth through continuous self and social reflection.\nC. True wellness requires a dedicated commitment to both personal and social solidarity.\nD. Wellness is not a static or assumed state, even when associated with positive school outcomes such as \nacademic achievement or desirable classroom behavior. Instead, it is the ongoing cultivation of curiosity, \nconnection, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution within and beyond the school setting.\nIII. Assumptions of Psychopathology and/or Disturbance\nA. Many social and personal disturbances can affect students and educators in schools, arising from both \ninternal and external forces within the school context.\nB. ASE adopts a strength-based orientation, recognizing disturbances as real in lived experiences, yet viewing \nthese experiences dynamically.\n1.\nAddressing personal or social factors influencing experiences is not about dismissing or reinterpreting \nthese influences. Instead, by applying the 5 Cs, ASE encourages students and educators to shape their \nexperiences in meaningful ways.\nIV. Therapeutic Change Process\nA. ASE-informed counselors utilize standard school counseling methods such as classroom instruction, small \ngroup and individual counseling, systems advocacy, and indirect services, delivered through structured \ncurriculum and spontaneous interactions.\nB. ASE prioritizes creating optimal conditions for wellness by building individual capacity and promoting \nequitable environments within schools and communities.\nC. The counselor, as part of a triad, works to support students and environments. This involves entering the \nstudent's world, understanding their circumstances, and empowering them to navigate different \ncontexts.\n1.\nStudents engage better when they feel connected to their environment, so counselors can foster a sense \nof safety and acceptance.\n2.\nCounselors should advocate for environmental changes that reinforce students\u2019 skills.\n3.\nCounselors should encourage self-reflection in students, helping them apply new strategies to various \ncontexts.\n4.\nReflexive interventions that complement students\u2019 and educators\u2019 growth can facilitate lasting \ndevelopment.\nV. ASE and Pertinence to Diverse Students and School Settings\nA. ASE approaches school counseling with attention to both personal and cultural diversity within students and \nthe broader educational and sociopolitical landscape.\nB. Each student is regarded as a cultural and personal agent, with unique levels of influence and expression.\nC. Schools mirror broader sociocultural systems, making it essential for counselors to respect school culture \nwhile advocating for improvements that support the liberation of students.\nVI. ASE and Empirical Studies\n\nA. ASE practitioners and researchers adopt a dialogical research stance, viewing data as approximations that \nsymbolize possible outcomes. School counselors critically use this data to advocate for students and \npromote effective school systems.\nB. Though limited, the school counseling field has conducted some research with ASE, making it one of the \nmost explored theories in school counseling.\n1.\nASE-related interventions have shown improvements in executive functioning, connectedness, curiosity, \nand academic achievement on standardized tests among diverse student groups in various settings.\n2.\nTeachers exposed to ASE interventions report reduced stress, enhanced mindfulness, and improved \nteacher-student relationships.\n4o", "Print 5.pdf": "In Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, reflections of \nfeeling is a counseling technique that centers on recognizing and affirming the student's \nemotional responses, particularly as they relate to interactions within their school environment. \nThis technique aligns with ASE\u2019s approach by situating students\u2019 feelings within the broader \ndynamics of their school relationships and culture, allowing students to see how their emotions \nare often influenced by environmental factors like peer dynamics, teacher expectations, or school \npolicies. By reflecting these feelings back to the student, counselors can help them understand \nthe connection between their internal experiences and external school influences, empowering \nthem to navigate these emotions within the context of their environment.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"I hear that you feel a bit isolated when working on group projects in class, especially \nwhen your ideas aren\u2019t considered. It sounds like the classroom setting isn\u2019t always \nmaking space for your voice, which must be really discouraging.\"\n2. \"It seems like you\u2019re feeling really stressed about keeping up with assignments because \nthe school\u2019s pace feels overwhelming at times. It must be hard to stay motivated when the \nenvironment feels so fast-paced and intense.\"\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, paraphrasing is \na counseling technique that involves restating the student\u2019s thoughts and concerns in the \ncounselor\u2019s own words. This approach helps clarify the student\u2019s meaning, confirm \nunderstanding, and encourage them to consider their thoughts within the larger school \nenvironment. In ASE, paraphrasing goes beyond simple reflection, guiding students to recognize \nhow their experiences and thoughts are shaped by school-related influences, like peer \ninteractions, academic pressures, and institutional structures. By linking personal concerns to \nthese external factors, paraphrasing can help students see their experiences as part of broader \ndynamics, facilitating self-awareness and encouraging proactive engagement with their school \nenvironment.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"So what I\u2019m hearing is that you feel frustrated when you don\u2019t have enough time to \ncomplete assignments, especially since it feels like the school\u2019s workload doesn\u2019t leave \nmuch room for breaks. It sounds like you\u2019re really aware of how the school\u2019s \nexpectations are impacting your ability to focus and do your best.\"\n2. \"You\u2019re saying that it\u2019s difficult to speak up in class discussions because you feel others \nmight judge your answers. It sounds like there\u2019s a strong social pressure here, and that\u2019s \nmaking it challenging to share your ideas openly.\"\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) \ntheory, confrontation is a counseling technique used to help students recognize discrepancies in \ntheir thoughts, behaviors, or beliefs, especially when these may be influenced by their school \nenvironment or when they impact their interactions within that context. This technique, while \ngentle and supportive, encourages students to reflect on inconsistencies that might be limiting \ntheir growth or sense of belonging in school. In ASE, confrontation is also about bringing to light \nthe ways school dynamics, such as peer influence or school norms, may shape a student's actions \nor attitudes, helping them understand and navigate these influences in a more constructive way.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n\n1. \"You\u2019ve mentioned that you want to feel more included by your classmates, but at the \nsame time, you often avoid group activities. Do you think that keeping to yourself might \nmake it harder for others to reach out to you as well?\"\n2. \"You\u2019ve shared that schoolwork is important to you and that you want to succeed, yet I \nnotice you often put off studying until the last minute. Could it be that some of the school \npressures or expectations might be making it tough for you to stay motivated?\"\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, reflection of \nmeaning is a counseling technique that focuses on helping students uncover and reflect on the \nunderlying significance and personal values behind their experiences within the school \nenvironment. This technique guides students to connect their actions, goals, and emotions with \ntheir broader purposes or values, particularly as these relate to their roles and relationships in \nschool. In ASE, reflection of meaning also emphasizes the dynamic interplay between the \nstudent\u2019s personal motivations and the social or academic culture of the school, allowing students \nto gain a deeper understanding of how school influences shape their sense of purpose.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"You\u2019ve shared that participating in sports helps you feel more confident and connected \nwith others. It sounds like being part of a team is important for you, not only for the \nactivity itself but also because it gives you a sense of belonging and support in the school \nenvironment.\"\n2. \"When you talk about working hard on school projects, you often mention how much it \nmatters to you to set a good example for your younger siblings. It seems like your \nmotivation isn\u2019t just about grades but also about showing them that school is a place \nwhere they can succeed and grow.\"\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, reframing is a \ncounseling technique that involves helping students shift their perspective on a situation or \nexperience to view it in a more positive or constructive light. This technique encourages students \nto consider alternative interpretations or meanings that may empower them to see challenges as \nopportunities for growth, learning, or connection within their school environment. Reframing \nacknowledges the complex interplay between personal experiences and the broader social \ncontext of the school, facilitating a more adaptive approach to challenges and fostering resilience \nin students.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"You mentioned feeling overwhelmed by your workload and thinking that you\u2019re not good \nenough to keep up. What if we reframe that feeling as an opportunity to develop better \ntime management skills? This could not only help you with your current classes but also \nprepare you for future challenges in school.\"\n2. \"I hear that you feel frustrated when classmates don\u2019t include you in group discussions. \nInstead of seeing it as a personal rejection, could we think about it as a chance for you to \nadvocate for yourself and express your ideas more confidently? Engaging with your peers \nmight strengthen your relationships and your voice in the classroom.\"\n\n1. Values Exploration Mapping\n\uf0b7\nGuide students to map out personal values and interests, connecting these with their \ngoals, actions, and potential influences from their school environment. This helps \nstudents visualize how their values align with the broader school community.\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, values \nexploration mapping is a counseling technique used to help students articulate, prioritize, and \nnavigate their personal values within their educational and social environments. This technique \nemphasizes understanding the ways in which students' values influence their motivations, \nbehaviors, and decision-making, particularly in contexts that include relationships with peers, \neducators, and broader school systems. By mapping out values, students are encouraged to \nrecognize how their individual preferences and beliefs align or differ from their environmental \ndemands, ultimately fostering a deeper awareness of personal agency and critical consciousness \nwithin their surroundings.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n\uf0b7\n\"Let\u2019s take a moment to think about a situation at school where you felt really proud of \nyour actions. What values do you think were guiding you at that time, and how might \nthose values help you navigate similar situations in the future?\"\n\uf0b7\n\"As you consider this decision, let\u2019s map out the values that feel most important to you. \nImagine where each value could fit in your choices\u2014are there any that stand out as \nessential to your goals or that might create tension in your school environment?\"\n2. Strength-Based Reflection\n\uf0b7\nFocus on identifying each student\u2019s unique strengths and skills. Use these strengths as a \nfoundation to build confidence and resilience, allowing students to approach challenges \nwith a sense of empowerment.\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, strength-\nbased reflection is a counseling technique that emphasizes identifying and building upon \nstudents\u2019 inherent strengths, talents, and personal achievements within their school and social \ncontexts. This approach encourages students to see themselves as resilient agents of change \ncapable of positively impacting their environment. By reflecting on past successes and positive \nqualities, students become more aware of their ability to overcome challenges and meet their \ngoals, empowering them to actively engage in their personal growth and social environments.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"I remember you mentioning how you managed to bring your group together on a recent \nproject, even though it was challenging. What qualities do you think you drew on to make \nthat happen, and how could those same strengths help you in other areas?\"\n2. \"You\u2019ve shown a lot of determination in improving your grades this semester. What do \nyou think has helped you stay motivated, and how might you apply that strength to tackle \nother goals you have in school or beyond?\"\n3. Guided Compassion Dialogues\n\n\uf0b7\nFacilitate discussions where students practice empathy by sharing and reflecting on each \nother\u2019s experiences, promoting compassion and connectedness within the school \ncommunity.\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, guided \ncompassion dialogues are a counseling technique that fosters self-compassion and empathy by \nhelping students to thoughtfully explore their feelings, motivations, and behaviors within a \nsupportive framework. Through these dialogues, students are guided to recognize and address \nchallenging emotions or social interactions with understanding and kindness, both toward \nthemselves and others. This technique is rooted in ASE\u2019s emphasis on co-regulation and \ninterconnectedness, encouraging students to see their experiences as part of a broader relational \ncontext and develop resilience through compassionate perspectives.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"It sounds like you were really hard on yourself after that presentation. Let\u2019s take a step \nback and look at it from a more compassionate angle\u2014what would you say to a friend \nwho felt the same way?\"\n2. \"When you think about the argument with your friend, what feelings come up? Let\u2019s \nexplore those emotions with a sense of understanding rather than judgment, so you can \ndecide on the best way to move forward and reconnect.\"\n4. Community Resource Mapping\n\uf0b7\nWork with students to identify resources within the school and the broader community \nthat can support their development. Encourage students to make connections with \nsupportive individuals and programs.\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, community \nresource mapping is a counseling technique that helps students identify and connect with \nsupportive resources within their school and local community. This approach aligns with ASE\u2019s \nemphasis on situating students within their broader environment, recognizing the value of \nexternal resources in fostering personal growth, resilience, and social support. By mapping \ncommunity resources, students become aware of various supportive networks and \nservices\u2014such as mentors, after-school programs, mental health services, or cultural \norganizations\u2014that they can utilize to enhance their well-being and academic or personal \nsuccess.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"Let\u2019s take a look at some community resources that align with your interests and needs. \nAre there any clubs, groups, or support services in the school or neighborhood that you\u2019d \nlike to learn more about?\"\n2. \"You mentioned feeling stressed about finding a place to study outside of school. Let\u2019s \nthink about some local spots or community centers that might offer a quiet space, and I \ncan help you identify which ones could be the best fit.\"\n5. Social Network Analysis\n\uf0b7\nHelp students assess their social networks to better understand the influences (both \npositive and negative) within their environment. Students can identify supportive \nrelationships and areas where they may need to set boundaries.\n\nIn Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, social network \nanalysis is a counseling technique used to help students examine and understand their social \nconnections within their school and community environments. This technique focuses on \nmapping out relationships and identifying the types of support, influence, and interaction patterns \npresent in a student\u2019s life. By analyzing their social network, students can recognize both positive \nand negative influences, understand their role within different social circles, and make \nintentional choices about who to seek for support or collaboration. This approach emphasizes \nASE\u2019s focus on the relational aspects of student experience and helps students build intentional, \nsupportive connections that can aid in their academic and personal development.\nExample Counselor Statements:\n1. \"Let\u2019s map out the people you interact with regularly, both in and out of school. Who do \nyou feel most supported by, and are there any relationships that you think might be \nchallenging for you right now?\"\n2. \"When you think about your friendships and connections, who stands out as someone \nwho shares similar goals or values? Identifying these people can help you build a \nnetwork that encourages and motivates you.\"\n6. Co-Regulation Strategies Workshop\n\uf0b7\nTeach students techniques for managing emotional states in social contexts. Use \nmindfulness, breathing exercises, and other co-regulation tools to enhance their ability to \nengage calmly and effectively with others.\n7. Perspective-Taking Exercises\n\uf0b7\nEncourage students to explore different viewpoints by placing themselves in another \nperson\u2019s shoes. This helps to build empathy and expand students' awareness of diverse \nperspectives within the school environment.\n8. Personal Narrative Development\n\uf0b7\nAssist students in creating personal narratives that reflect their identities, values, and \naspirations. This helps students see themselves as authors of their own stories and \npromotes self-reflection and agency.\n9. School Climate Feedback Loop\n\uf0b7\nCollaborate with students to gather feedback on their perceptions of the school climate. \nUse their insights to advocate for systemic improvements and involve students in \ninitiatives that enhance school inclusivity and equity.\n10. Critical Consciousness Building\n\uf0b7\nIntroduce students to social justice concepts, empowering them to critically analyze \nsystems of power and oppression. Encourage them to think about ways they can effect \npositive change in their own school and community.\n11. Mindfulness for Allostasis\n\uf0b7\nTeach mindfulness techniques that help students adapt to stress in healthy ways, \nsupporting allostasis. Help them understand the importance of maintaining balance and \nflexibility in the face of life\u2019s challenges.\n12. Values-Based Goal Setting\n\uf0b7\nFacilitate goal-setting sessions that align with students\u2019 core values. This approach \nensures that goals are personally meaningful and motivating, rather than externally \nimposed.\n13. Peer Mentoring Circles\n\n\uf0b7\nOrganize small peer groups where students mentor and support each other in achieving \npersonal and academic goals. Encourage students to share resources and strategies, \nfostering a sense of community.\n14. Growth Mindset Journaling\n\uf0b7\nEncourage students to maintain journals that document their challenges, achievements, \nand reflections. This can reinforce a growth mindset by highlighting the progress they \nmake over time.\n15. Skill-Building Workshops\n\uf0b7\nOffer workshops focused on building executive functioning, communication, and \nproblem-solving skills. Frame these workshops around developing capacities that are \nuseful both in school and in life.\n16. Empathy Mapping\n\uf0b7\nGuide students through exercises where they identify the feelings, thoughts, and needs of \nothers. This helps them to practice empathy and consider the broader social dynamics at \nplay within their environment.\n17. Resilience-Building Dialogues\n\uf0b7\nUse storytelling and guided conversations to discuss how students can overcome \nchallenges. Focus on building resilience and showing students that obstacles can be \nopportunities for growth.\n18. Community Engagement Projects\n\uf0b7\nEncourage students to participate in or design service projects that benefit the school or \nlocal community. Emphasize the importance of contributing to the well-being of others \nwhile gaining practical skills.\n19. Reflection and Regeneration Sessions\n\uf0b7\nHold periodic reflection sessions where students assess their growth and consider areas \nfor further development. Encourage them to think about how they can continue evolving \nas individuals and as members of the community.\n20. Collective Problem-Solving Exercises\n\uf0b7\nPresent group challenges that require collaboration and creative thinking. Guide students \nin approaching these problems as a team, promoting both individual agency and \ncollective responsibility.\n21. Self-Advocacy Training\n\uf0b7\nTeach students how to identify and communicate their needs effectively. Equip them with \nstrategies to advocate for themselves within the school system and beyond.\n22. Gratitude Practice\n\uf0b7\nEncourage students to engage in regular gratitude exercises that focus on appreciating \nboth personal achievements and positive aspects of their school environment. This can \nenhance students\u2019 well-being and strengthen their connections with others.\n23. Cultural Awareness Activities\n\uf0b7\nIncorporate activities that celebrate and explore cultural diversity. This promotes \ninclusivity and helps students understand the importance of respecting and valuing \ndifferences.\n24. Environmental Influence Journals\n\uf0b7\nHave students keep a journal where they reflect on how various aspects of their \nenvironment (people, settings, events) impact their thoughts, feelings, and actions. This \n\nincreases self-awareness and helps them identify constructive ways to engage with their \nsurroundings.\n25. Vision for the Future Sessions\n\uf0b7\nFacilitate sessions where students create a vision for their future, including personal, \nacademic, and community-related aspirations. Encourage them to consider how they can \ncontribute to a more positive and equitable world.\n\nReflecting Feelings\nHumanistic counseling: \nExample 1: As we are talking about your parents, I can see the profound grief that you\u2019re \nexperiencing (empathy). This is more than a memory, but a feeling that you carry with you even \nnow in this room after all these years (here-and-now; experiential). \nExample 2: I noticed you pulled backed when I said that; fearful of what you\u2019re experiencing \nnow as we talk about what you experienced in the past (here-and-now; immediacy & authentic \nexperience) \nCognitive behavioral counseling: \nExample 1: Witnessing the grief of others (activating event) reminds the struggles you endured \nafter your own parents passed away, and now you believe that you will never escape the feelings \nof despair (beliefs), which in turn compels you to limit your interactions with other people in \nyour life (consequence). \nExample 2: You attach shame to your experiences of grief; a belief which has haunted you for \ndecades (Core belief)\nPost-modern counseling: \nExample 1: The grief still persists from the loss of your parents; some days are better than others \n(deconstruction; dominant story; externalizing). This illustrates that you are more than your \ngrief, you are someone who can suffer deeply and also someone who experiences deep joy \n(reauthoring).  \nAdvocating Student-with-Environment:\nExample 1: You\u2019re experience of grief (curiosity and connectedness) affects you deeply \n(compassion) and in different ways across different circumstances (co-regulation). \nExample 2: The loss you experienced is associated with a feeling of distress, yet sadness is \ncoupled with this profound passion to support your family members as they are also grieving \n(contribution).  \nQuestions:\nHumanistic counseling: \nExample 1: How does reflecting on the past affect you in this moment? (here-and-now; \nexperiential)\nExample 2: You\u2019ve endured much and I witness your resilience.  In a similar way, I wonder what \nyou learned about yourself?  (meaning)\nExample 3: You work hard to maintain your composure, but what is your fidgeting knee tell us if \nit could speak?  (somatic here-and-now)   \nCognitive behavioral counseling: \n\nExample 1: (downward arrow) 1) Can you tell me what you experienced when you were taking \nthe test?  (minor mode) 2) Okay, so felt anxious because you had the impression that you were \nnot performing well after much preparation. If true, from your perspective, what does this \nexperience tell you about yourself as a learner?  (protoschema) 3) So you interpreted this one \nanxiety laden experience as reflective of your total ability as a learner.  How might you then \ndescribe yourself as a learner generally?  4) You have this circular experience, you believe that \nyou are incapable of learning even when preparing, which leads to anxiety in performance \nsituations, contributing to undesirable learning outcomes and now this larger belief that you are \nunable to learn or demonstrate your learning?  (core belief)\nPost-modern counseling: \nExample 1: I wonder how someone else might interpret this experience in class. Think of \nthe most charitable person you know, if she or he knew how anxious you were in class \nhow might they interpret your performance after studying so many hours? (externalizing)\nExample 2: Let\u2019s not disregard this recent episode, but let\u2019s also not focus only here.  \nCould you describe to me some occasions when you had a different experience in a \nsimilar situation? (exceptions)\nAdvocating Student-with-Environment:\nExample 1: What aspects from your classroom experiences most affect how you \nparticipate as a student (curiosity, co-regulation, and contribution)?  \nExample 2: Who in class is most helpful when you are struggling (co-regulation)?  \nExample 3: How might you notice when your attention starts to get distracted (co-\nregulation)?  What things typically occur in class when you start to experience distraction \n(curiosity)? \nTo further illustrate how ASE theory employs reflections of feelings and questions to \nsupport the development of children, I (Matthew) was supervising my five-year-old son and his \n4-year-old cousin.  After a few normal disagreements, my son said that he wanted to play by \nhimself, assumingly to avoid further conflict.  This greatly disappointed my nephew who \napparently felt rejected and angry, as he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t play with me, I am going to hit you.\u201d  \nMy response to my nephew was something like the following: \nMatthew:  I see that you\u2019re quite angry when Atom (my son) said that he wanted to play \nalone.  You were so upset that you said you\u2019re going to hit him.\nNephew:  Yes, I am so angry at Atom. \n\nMatthew:  I wonder if you can tell me all of the different things that you can do when you \nget this angry?  \nNephew: (listed about 3 strategies his parents had formerly introduced)\nMatthew:  That\u2019s a lot of ways to express anger; I wonder which ones might make you \nfeel just a little bit better?\u201d\nhttps://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=advocatingstudentw\nithinenvironment", "Print 7.pdf": "Chapter 1\nASE Theory: Introduction and History\nMatthew E. Lemberger-Truelove\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-8916-9678\nHannah Bowers Parker\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-2263-2370\n\nChapter 1 Abstract\nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) is a theory of practice that was developed \nspecifically for school counseling professionals.  In this chapter, ASE theory is introduced as a \nsystems approach to working with individual students, groups of students, educators, and other \nschool-related stakeholders. As an approach to practice, adherents to ASE theory provide direct \nservices to students and the people influential to their lives as co-determinants of experience. In \nthis chapter, the basic philosophical and practice priorities are introduced, as is the brief history \nof the theory development.  \n\nSchool environments are constituted by groups of students, educators, administrators, \nguardians, policy makers, and other community members.  These individuals coalesce in schools \nas dynamic systems, where each constituent ingredient of the school is affected by the whole, \nand the whole school environment is affected by each part (Parsons, 1959).  In this manner, \ninterventions in schools that are intended to cultivate student development or promote school and \nsocietal successes must be performed in ways that are relevant to individuals and the total school \nsystem as co-determinants.  \nSchool counselors are professional educators and mental health service providers in \nschools (Levy & Lemberger-Truelove, 2021). Traditionally, many school counselors were \ntrained to use practice approaches primarily concerned with intervening with a student or adult \nindividually, but not how the various systems affect personal and social co-determinants of \nexperience.  In recent years, authors have posited frameworks intended to inform school \ncounseling practices from an ecological or systems perspective (e.g., Bryan & Henry, 2012; \nLemberger-Truelove & Bowers, 2019; McMahon & Mason, 2019).  Relatedly, several \nrecommendations have been made for school counselors to pursue social justice outcomes, \nincluding anti-discrimination and equity praxis (e.g., Griffin & Steen, 2011; Holcomb-McCoy, \n2022).  One ecological and social justice approach to school counseling is the Advocating \nStudent-within-Environment (ASE) theoretical framework (Lemberger, 2010; Lemberger & \nHutchison, 2014; Lemberger-Truelove & Bowers, 2019).  ASE has been utilized in several \nempirical studies, demonstrating desirable outcomes for K12 students and educators (Bowers et \nal., 2020; Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2021; Lemberger-Truelove et al., in press; Molina et al., \n2022; Webb et al., 2019).  Adherents of the ASE approach propound that school professionals \nintervene with students and adult stakeholders in corresponding ways such that each individual \n\nand the total school system ripen into co-regulated experiences and outcomes (Lemberger-\nTruelove & Bowers, 2019). \nThe ASE theory of school counseling is patently an ecological-systems approach (see \nBronfenbrenner, 1977).  Systems approaches are concerned with the influence of various social \nstructures on individuals and groups.  Yet ASE is also be associated with the various liberation \npsychologies (e.g., Fanon, 1963; Freire, 1970; Marti\u0301n-Baro\u0301, 1994).  Liberation psychologies are \ndialogical in that they are attentive to societal forces (particularly those that marginalize and \noppress) and yet offer insights for how an individual can transcend being entirely consumed by \nsocial influence.  As a liberatory systems approach to school counseling, the primary concern of \nASE practitioners is how one can support the development of students\u2019 personal and learning \ncapacities while pursuing more socially just and facilitative environmental conditions.\nASE theory operates from a dialogical epistemological base (Bakhtin, 1973), hence the \nphrasing of student-within-environment. Dialogical suggests that there is some nonreductive \nconcept of a unique self or personal identity that is generally material. At the same time, this \nconcept of self is distributed amongst several social influences and iterations over time and \nacross circumstance, held together loosely by various memories and stories (Hermans, 2014; \nHermans et al., 1992). Therefore, the student is wholly constituted by the various systems of \ninfluence and yet becomes different as those systems converge into first-person experience.  As \nsuch, it is reasonable that any intervention in a school must be germane to the student and the \nfeatures of the school environment as co-determinants of experience.     \nA school counselor practicing from ASE theory intervenes to help students master \naptitudes stifled by restrictive environments (Lemberger-Truelove & Bowers, 2019). Such \naptitudes include cognitive abilities, including executive functioning (i.e., self-monitoring; \n\nemotional control; task initiation, organizing, monitoring, shifting, and completion), which are \nregulatory activities necessary to pursue intended goals (Diamond, 2013). By addressing targeted \naptitudes, co-regulatory relationships can form between students, school professionals, family \nmembers, and members of the broader society. Co-regulation is a term often utilized in \ntraditional family systems work and refers to the bidirectional oscillating of communitive and \nemotional channels between partners (Butler & Randall, 2013). This co-regulatory relationship \nbegins in infancy between mother and child as they form a relationship through behavioral and \nemotional synchrony (Butler & Randall, 2013; Tronick et al., 1978). Within the school setting, a \nco-regulatory relationship occurs as students or members of the school community engage in \npurposive solidarity intended to co-determine learning and social development (McCaslin, 2009). \nThrough ASE, students, family members, school professionals, and relevant community \nmembers increase awareness of their unique social functioning and create connections with \nothers, feeling as though they are not alone in their unique situations that can otherwise appear \nextremely isolating.  Students that feel more connected to their schools have greater academic \noutcomes (McClure et al., 2010). Furthermore, those students who feel a greater sense of \nbelonging attribute those feelings to teacher support and positive personal characteristics (Allen \net al., 2016; Malecki & Demaray, 2003).  At home, students who reported having supportive \nrelationships with their parents were found to have better personal adjustment (Malecki & \nDemaray, 2003).  For parents of school-aged children, interventions that engage families in \nschool activities can result in those parents reporting more educational involvement, greater \namounts of parent-teacher communication, and more encouraging parental attitudes towards their \nchildren\u2019s school environment (Chen, Anderson, & Watkins, 2016).  In a similar way, teachers \nwho report feeling connected to their schools have increased job satisfaction, and, in turn, their \n\nstudents generally perform better academically.  Together, these studies illustrate how tightly \nbound school systems affect people\u2019s experiences and school-related outcomes. \nApproaches to school counseling that focus primarily at the single-student level tend to \nneglect the profound influences of the various systems that affect students.  Conversely, a \nsingular focus on social systems neglects the primary concern of most schooling interventions, \nthat is how does one support the development of the student.  The student internalizes the various \nsocial forces in and beyond the school environment as the most relevant and viable agent to \nchange the school and other social systems.  There are also ethical and pedagogical reasons to \nsupport student-within-environment.  It is entirely laudable for a school counselor to pursue \nchange at the systems level on behalf of students. In so doing, that school counselor \ninadvertently becomes the arbitrator of what is just and appropriate for that student.  Relatedly, \nthe student is not necessarily empowered to define and pursue change, which seems shortsighted \ngiven the inevitability of change in the system (e.g., the student will eventually graduate or leave \nthe school, or social forces might evolve over time).  The student is not fully responsible for \npersonal or social change, yet the student is always embedded within systems. Therefore, any \nintervention must engage the student and members of the school environment in appropriate and \nempowering ways.  \nA Brief History of ASE Theory for School Counseling\nThere exist hundreds of approaches to counseling and that, across these various \napproaches, the client outcomes are generally consistent and promising (Laska et al., 2014).  \nAdding one more log to the flame might appear superfluous with such an abundance of helpful \nframeworks.  Yet we (Matthew and Hannah) believe there is a unique urgency for theory \n\nspecifically tailored to how school counselors support K12 students and other people in school \nenvironments.  \nAcross the various theoretical approaches of counseling, select scholars have identified \ncommon factors that contribute to desirable client outcomes across all the various approaches \n(Cuijpers et al., 2019; Wampold, 2015).  Given these empirical findings across thousands of \ncounseling studies, one might erroneously assume that theory has little utility in a school \ncounselor's work, especially considering the various clear educational and uneven mental health \nroles and responsibilities associated with the profession.  Peering into these common factors it \nbecomes increasingly clear that the common factors do not necessarily suggest that one become \ntheoretically agonistic or even a practice chameleon. Instead, the common factors literature \nsuggests that the various approaches to practice can contribute to similar desirable outcomes and \nthat one\u2019s choice of theory to inform practice should fit the needs of the anticipated client and \nsetting.  \nUnfortunately, many school counselors entirely disregard theory, or it only vaguely \ninforms one\u2019s preferences as a practitioner (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2020). It is no wonder \nthat many school counselors and the people we serve are confused about the type and magnitude \nof mental health service provided by school counselors. In the absence of a clear and germane \nframework, practice can become ambiguous or even irrelevant. Alternatively, returning to the \ncommon factors literature, qualities such as belief in the capacity of the client to develop in \nintended ways, the cultural appositeness of the practice approach, and the shared agreements in \ntreatment each indicate that having some theory that is specifically attuned to the client context is \nvital. \n\nCertainly, each established approach to child development and counseling theory is at \nleast minimally relevant to school counseling (ASCA, 2019). Alternatively, one might question \nif these classical frameworks provide a thoroughgoing relevance to the school as a setting for \ntreatment, the disposition of students as clients, and the roles and responsibilities of school \ncounselors as interventionists. While classical approaches inform, they might not provide precise \ninsights that capture practice behaviors or empirical scholarship for school counseling.  Also, \nmany of the classical theories were developed for clinical settings and greatly influenced by a \nmedicalized way of treating the individual client or patient (Hansen, 2008), which contrasts with \nthe suggested focus of professional counselors who are concerned with development, prevention, \nwellness, and social justice (Levy & Lemberger-Truelove, 2021; Myer, 1992). \nThe fitness of theory on practice and professional values also potentially extends to its \nempirical relevance.  Classical theories may or may not necessarily align with the practice \nlanguage that occurs in schools (e.g., classroom guidance counseling, which is generally \npsychoeducational interventions delivered to entire groups of students in classrooms) or all \ndesired outcomes (e.g., academic achievement).  For example, students exposed to counseling \nmight experience actualization (person-centered counseling or existential) or develop more \nadaptive thoughts (cognitive behavioral therapy), but how these concepts pertain to education-\nspecific operations such as a student\u2019s executive functioning (i.e., capacities contributing to \nemotional and cognitive regulation for goal-focused behavior) can be unclear.  Furthermore, the \nlanguage used in counseling or psychological theories might not track on the nomenclature used \nby educators or other school stakeholders.  For these and other empirical reasons (e.g., treatment \nfidelity in school settings), it is no wonder that school counseling intervention studies only \nconstitute 0.1% of the counseling literature (Griffith et al., 2019). \n\nASE theory was developed to specifically account for the nuances of school counseling.  \nEach of the concepts found in ASE can be found in the works of other theorists or scholars, yet \nas they converge into a single kaleidoscopic framework. these concepts manifest into something \nuniquely fit for school counseling practice.  This emergence is consistent with an assumption \nbaked into ASE itself: prior influences come together in ways that both reflect their influences. \nYet, the assemblage of these conceptions is altogether unique as they converge.\nMatthew and ASE Theory \nAkin to many of the historical approaches to counseling, the infancy of ASE theory can \nbe traced back to the personal history and preferences of the initial architect of the theory.  For \nme (Matthew), ASE is undoubtedly related to my personal and professional backgrounds.  My \nfather did not make it out of middle school, and my mother struggled with reading and education \nher entire life.  From an early age, I experienced how ruptures in education, social and family \nstrife, and economic struggle affected my personal, social, and learning development.  Although \nI did well during my school years, throughout my life I have often wondered how things might \nhave differed had there been greater educational and personal support.    \nThe influences of my youth certainly catalyzed many of the concepts found in ASE, but \nthere was a single moment when those ideas started to take shape as a formal system.  As an \nundergraduate, I enrolled in a graduate-level course on the philosophy of education.  In that \ncourse, I was exposed to the ideas of Dewey (1916), Freire (1970), and Vygotsky (1978).  I was \nroused by their ideals but suspicious that their postulates could be vivified in contemporary \nclassrooms.  I pondered, \u201cWhat kind of educator builds the learning and social capacities of the \nstudent while challenging the various social structures that limit equitable and just education?\u201d \nAs I reminisce about those questions, I cannot accurately recall the ideas that contributed to my \n\nresolve. However, I was convinced that school counselors were these underutilized educators \nwith the professional dispositions and access to bring life to those philosophers of education.  So, \nI did my best to identify the school counseling professors most closely aligned with my \ndeveloping values.  \nInitially, I could not find too many intervention articles in the literature, which I chalked \nup to my shortcomings as an undergraduate.  Undeterred, I continued to probe the literature, and \nI finally found one article that was published the year I was graduating (Brigman et al., 1999).  In \nthe article, Brigman and colleagues discussed findings from an intervention targeting students\u2019 \nattending and self-regulatory, learning, and social strategies.  I packed up my modest belongings \nand relocated to Florida to start a master\u2019s program in school counseling under the tutelage of \nDr. Brigman.  \nThe timing could not have been more serendipitous as Dr. Brigman was in the early \nstages of developing a comprehensive manualized school counseling intervention across K-12.  I \nwas his first graduate assistant supporting what would become the Student Success Skills (SSS) \nsuite of interventions, which includes small and large group student counseling activities and \nconsultation services to teachers and guardians (https://studentsuccessskills.com).   Independent \nscholars have evaluated SSS and considered it one of the few evidence-based interventions with \noutcomes specifically attributed to the work of school counselors (Carey et al., 2008).    \nAs a comprehensive theory for school counseling practice, ASE is compatible with the \nmanualized SSS curriculum and yet does go beyond in many important ways.  For example, SSS \ndoes suggest that school counselors pursue collaborative and helpful classroom climates, \nwhereas ASE places systemic advocacy as a central value and practice behavior for school \ncounselors.  Also, while SSS includes various strategies and practices that can be reduced to \n\nbroader school counseling practice, the intervention is mostly specific to the contents of the \nvarious SSS manuals.  ASE, on the other hand, is compliant to manualized interventions, \nincluding and beyond SSS. However, as a comprehensive theory, it includes a distinguishable \nepistemology, suppositions about student or systemic wellness and deficit, and practice \nbehaviors that are generalizable to various settings and circumstances in school systems.  \nThe first writings about ASE theory occurred during the last semesters of my master\u2019s \nprogram (circa 2001), but it was not until almost a decade later that these ideas started appearing \nin published works (e.g., Lemberger, 2010).  The initial concern was to highlight the importance \nof working collaboratively with students and educators, as opposed to one or the other discretely.  \nMore recently, most ASE-related publications have been randomized controlled trials \nconsidering outcomes on students or their teachers (Lemberger-Truelove et al., 2021; \nLemberger-Truelove et al., in press).  Looking to the future, there is no intention for ASE to be \nreified as a stable theoretical approach; instead, the hope is that more individuals will challenge \nand improve the theory, practice, and empirical investigation of ASE, with the ultimate goal that \nit can stable enough to provide helpful guidance to practicing school counselors but also prove \nadaptive enough to continue to support changes in future student and school cultures.  \nFor me (Matthew), the real need for the development of ASE was to provide school \ncounselors with an approach specific to working with children as students in schools.  From a \nyoung age, school systems did not serve me or many of the people I grew up with in my \nneighborhood.  I wanted to recruit school counselors as allies who could empower students while \nsimultaneously challenging schools to be more relevant and helpful.  ASE is intended to be a \ncomplete theory for school counselors, and yet it will never be fully finalized; instead, to remain \n\npertinent to complex students and school systems, it is intended to be a framework that evolves \nwith different voices and demands.  \nHannah and ASE Theory \nMy relationship with ASE theory mirrors many of the readers of this text. That is, I \njoined a movement of thought that transformed my practice personally and professionally. For \nme, ASE is like putting on glasses that finally have the right prescription, when for years, I had \nbeen squinting, trying to read the letters on the page. However, it is all a journey, and I have \nlearned that professional practice often intersects personal experience and genuinely \nexperiencing challenges leads to the most remarkable growth. \nI have always been conscious of systemic influences throughout my life. As a young \nadolescent, I witnessed my mother\u2019s transformation as she engaged in personal therapy to better \nmanage relationships. Her therapeutic process began a journey of reflection and transparency of \nrelational patterns, almost to a point where the behaviors of those within my family appeared \npredetermined. Watching my mother\u2019s growth from a co-dependent caregiver to an extremely \nindependent woman, challenging sociocultural norms that defined her generation, was \nremarkable and awe-inspiring, illuminating the power of the therapeutic process.  \nWhile experience led to interest, my master\u2019s degree in marriage and family therapy \nprovided a foundation of knowledge about systems, beginning with the basics of scientific \nthought applied to family functioning from Gregory Bateson (1941) towards pushing the \nboundaries of how knowledge is constructed by Kenneth Gergen (1985) and the evolution of \nfamily therapy as the field transformed through the waves of behaviorism, cognitive, to post-\nmodernism, and social justice. Foundationally, my perspective of the world remained unchanged \n(if not more post-modern): We are a product of the systems by which we live. While I could see \n\nsuch truths clearly from my own experience, it was not until that first real-world counseling \nopportunity that I immersed myself in educational disparities. \nWorking with a group of adolescent males required to complete counseling through the \njuvenile court system, I felt hopeless. Who was there to help these boys, who often lacked \nfamilial support and encouragement, who often expressed that no one cared about them at home \nor school. While employing evidence-based practices at this level, I wondered if a change would \noccur for any of these young men. Matthew provided me with a viewpoint, but I was not ready to \nembrace it at that time. \nWhen I was first presented with ASE, I honestly had to sit with it. Matthew had just \nsuccessfully published his first conceptual ASE manuscript during my first semester as a \ndoctoral student. I was too novice in my counseling experience and lacked the confidence to \nchallenge what I already knew. However, through continued experiences working with students \nas a school-based counselor and school counselor, I began to make sense of ASE. I became more \nmindful of our dialect, seeking to understand the student from their viewpoint and join them in \ntheir world. Goals were not directed by the school or parents but rather for themselves. In going \na step further, I began attending health and wellness meetings to advocate for the student, engage \nin conversations with parents from a perspective of curiosity, as well as provide advocacy to \nencourage dialogue at home. My practice focus shifted, still maintaining a systemic perspective \nas I moved into the role of a school counselor and eventual school counselor educator, but with a \nfocus more so on advocacy. I wanted students, who often felt so isolated and alone, type-casted \ninto a specific social group, or struggling with symptoms of mental health or neurodiversity, to \nlearn skills to become stronger and to advocate for themselves.\n\nThe intersection of experience and knowledge is where ASE lands for me today. While \nMatthew has provided the foundation, others have contributed perspectives that push ASE to \nnew horizons (e.g., Johnson, et al., in press; Liu et al., 2020; Roche et al., 2020; Zyromski et al., \n2022), providing intentionality behind each decision. As a school counselor, ASE is grounded in \nthe mission and vision of a school counseling program, focused on providing all students with \nthe skillsets that promote success in school and life. I embrace ASE not just as a counselor or \ncounselor educator but also as a mother. Advocacy for my neurodiverse children is profound, as \nwell as co-regulating experiences within the home to ensure they can practice and develop the \nskillsets needed to succeed in their future. While my conscious experience began with systemic \nawareness, growing into ASE has shifted from theory into a way of being. \nThe Present Book\nThe current book intends to provide readers with a basic primer on the assumptions and \npractice priorities related to the ASE school counseling theory.  Chapters 1, 2, and 3 explain \nsome of the most foundational assumptions of ASE and provide some general suggestions for \npractice.  These chapters are mostly organized around the 5Cs of ASE theory, a memory device \nintended to inform how a school counselor assesses students and school systems, pursues \npractice and advocacy behaviors, and evaluates anticipated outcomes.  The 5Cs of ASE include \ncuriosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution.  Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 \ninclude applications to specific educational contexts.  These topics are not necessarily \nexhaustive, but they might provide school counselors with more specific ideas on ASE in \npractice with certain student or school system concerns.  Finally, in Chapter 9, we discuss some \nof the recent empirical studies performed using ASE as the theoretical guide and provide school \n\ncounseling practitioners and scholars with recommendations for empirical practice as informed \nspecifically by ASE theory.    \nThis text should elucidate the spirit of ASE.  Schools are systems that are influenced by \nvarious personal and social forces.  Students, educators, and other people affiliated with schools \nare also systems in that they have been profoundly influenced by external and internal forces.  \nThe stance of ASE suggests that the most influential approach to school counseling requires \nsupport directly to the student and at the school system levels as co-determinants of experience.  \n\nReferences\nAmerican School Counselor Association (ASCA) (2019).

Holistic Support: ASE theory emphasizes the importance of considering the \ninterconnected systems\u2014such as family, school, and community\u2014that influence \na student's well-being and development. Similarly, the non-dual educator-\ncounselor identity promotes an integrated approach where educators and \ncounselors do not operate in isolated roles but instead combine their expertise to \nsupport the student as a whole. This approach means that academic instruction \nand emotional support are intertwined, reinforcing each other to promote \ncomprehensive student success.\n2. Interrelated Roles: Levy and Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s concept of non-dual identity \nsuggests that educators and counselors should embody a unified professional \nstance where teaching and counseling merge into a seamless practice. This \ndirectly complements ASE theory by highlighting how school staff can act as \nadvocates within their overlapping functions, ensuring that students receive \nconsistent and comprehensive support both academically and emotionally.\n3. Advocacy as a Shared Responsibility: In the framework of ASE theory, \nadvocacy is crucial for addressing systemic issues that impact students' \nexperiences within and beyond the school environment. The non-dual educator-\ncounselor identity aligns with this by encouraging teachers and counselors to \nshare responsibility for advocating for students' needs. Whether through \nclassroom guidance, curriculum design, or socio-emotional interventions, this \nintegrated identity supports the notion that advocating for students should be a \nunified effort involving all educational stakeholders.\nPractical Implications:\n\uf0b7\nIntegrated Practices: The concept of non-dual identity encourages practices \nwhere academic and counseling activities overlap. For example, a teacher with \ncounseling skills might use reflective questioning to help students connect \nacademic content to their personal experiences, while a counselor may \nincorporate educational strategies in their individual or group sessions. This \nholistic approach aligns with ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on understanding and \naddressing students\u2019 needs within the broader context of their environment.\n\uf0b7\nCollaborative Advocacy: ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on student-environment \ninteractions suggests that true advocacy requires collaboration among educators, \ncounselors, parents, and community members. The non-dual identity reinforces \nthis by enabling educators to act as advocates within their teaching roles and \ncounselors to support educational objectives in their guidance roles, breaking \ndown barriers between these functions for a unified approach.\n\nExamples:\n\uf0b7\nIn the Classroom: A teacher operating within the non-dual educator-counselor \nidentity might integrate socio-emotional learning into their lessons, recognizing \nhow emotional states and learning environments affect academic performance. \nThis integration mirrors ASE theory by acknowledging that a student\u2019s success is \ntied to both their internal and external environments.\n\uf0b7\nSchool-wide Initiatives: Counselors and teachers can collaborate on programs \nthat address both academic skills and emotional well-being, such as mentoring \nprograms or community engagement projects. These initiatives align with ASE \ntheory\u2019s view that students thrive when their educational experiences reflect an \nunderstanding of their broader life contexts.\nConclusion:\nLemberger-Truelove's ASE theory and the non-dual educator-counselor identity \nconverge on the principle that effective support for students involves a comprehensive, \nintegrated approach. By viewing education and counseling as intertwined rather than \nseparate functions, educators and counselors can work together to advocate for and \nsupport students in a way that considers their entire environment. This unified identity \nfosters a school culture where students\u2019 academic and personal growth are seen as \ninterconnected and equally essential.\nSOMETHING on the nuances of direct services in secondary schools delivered by \nSCs\u2026 \nLemberger-Truelove's Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory aligns \nclosely with the principles of a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) in its approach \nto meeting diverse student needs through a tiered, contextually aware framework. Both \nASE theory and MTSS emphasize the importance of an environment-responsive, \nlayered approach to address varying levels of academic, behavioral, and social-\nemotional needs, making ASE theory a particularly supportive model for implementing \nMTSS effectively within schools.\n1. Tiered Support Structure:\nASE theory\u2019s focus on understanding and addressing the complex interactions between \nstudents and their environments complements MTSS\u2019s tiered structure. MTSS provides \nthree levels of intervention, beginning with broad, school-wide supports (Tier 1), \nfollowed by targeted supports for groups of students needing additional help (Tier 2), \nand intensive, individualized interventions for those with the most significant needs (Tier \n3). ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on the contextual influences of the school environment on \nstudents mirrors MTSS\u2019s approach, recognizing that interventions should be scaffolded \nand responsive to the individual\u2019s unique circumstances and background. ASE theory \nfurther supports MTSS\u2019s goals by encouraging interventions that respect and respond to \neach student\u2019s interaction with their school and broader community, which is especially \nrelevant in tailoring tiered supports.\n2. Focus on Prevention and Development:\nMTSS is built on a preventative framework, aiming to identify and support students early \nbefore issues become severe. ASE theory shares this preventative focus, emphasizing \nproactive approaches that prioritize wellness, social-emotional development, and \n\nacademic support. Through this lens, ASE encourages school counselors and \neducators to use a developmental, strengths-based approach to create positive \nchanges in both students and their environments. For example, within Tier 1, ASE-\ninformed counselors might promote universal classroom strategies that foster a sense \nof connectedness, compassion, and community, reinforcing the social-emotional \nfoundation essential to MTSS.\n3. Data-Driven, Context-Aware Interventions:\nMTSS is inherently data-driven, relying on assessments to monitor student progress, \nevaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and make necessary adjustments. ASE \ntheory\u2019s focus on the individual within their environmental context aligns well with this \napproach, as it advocates for data-informed decisions that account for the ecological \nand situational factors impacting student performance and behavior. ASE theory \nencourages counselors and educators to assess not only the student\u2019s immediate \nneeds but also the broader social, cultural, and familial influences that might inform \ntargeted or individualized supports in Tier 2 or Tier 3 interventions. For instance, \nunderstanding a student\u2019s familial or cultural background can help counselors design \nculturally responsive supports that meet their unique needs.\n4. Promoting Collaboration and Advocacy:\nMTSS requires collaboration among school counselors, educators, administrators, and \nfamilies to ensure the holistic support of each student. ASE theory\u2019s advocacy \ncomponent aligns with this collaborative spirit, encouraging school counselors to act as \nadvocates not only for individual students but also for systemic changes that support all \nstudents. ASE-informed school counselors work closely with teachers and families to \nidentify ways the school environment itself can evolve to better serve diverse needs, \nwhich is consistent with MTSS\u2019s aim of creating inclusive, responsive school \nenvironments. For example, in ASE-informed Tier 1 activities, school counselors may \nwork alongside teachers to advocate for practices that build a supportive school culture \nor provide resources to meet community-specific needs, reinforcing MTSS\u2019s inclusive \nand collaborative framework.\nConclusion:\nASE theory and MTSS share a foundational commitment to adaptable, data-informed, \nand environmentally responsive practices that address the full spectrum of student \nneeds. Through a contextually aware approach, ASE theory provides school counselors \nand educators with a valuable framework for implementing MTSS in ways that are \nsensitive to individual backgrounds, ecological influences, and developmental stages. \nBy emphasizing both prevention and the ongoing evolution of school systems, ASE \ntheory supports MTSS\u2019s goal of creating school environments that are both effective \nand equitable for all students.\nPart of the problem might be the over reliance on formal curriculum or programing to \ndeliver SC initiatives\u2026 whereas ASE suggests that SCs pursue formal interventions \nincluding but also moreover ASE is a value structure that informs practice\u2026 in the spirit \nof non-dual, then every moment is an opportunity to affect students and total systems \n\nResearch on school counselors delivering direct counseling interventions in secondary \nschools underscores their critical role in supporting academic, social-emotional, and \ncareer development through direct services. Studies indicate that secondary school \ncounselors tend to offer fewer direct counseling services compared to counselors in \nelementary schools due to larger caseloads, increased administrative duties, and more \ncomplex needs across the adolescent age range. However, the types of services they \ndo provide at this level are often geared toward supporting students' transition to post-\nsecondary opportunities, addressing mental health concerns, and managing academic \ndemands, which are particularly pronounced at the high school level.\nAmounts and Types of Services\nSecondary school counselors typically provide a range of services, including individual \ncounseling, small group interventions, academic and career counseling, and crisis \nintervention. However, research suggests that the proportion of time spent on direct \nservices at the secondary level is often limited by structural factors, such as high \nstudent-to-counselor ratios and additional responsibilities for administrative tasks and \nstandardized testing coordination. For example, studies report that secondary \ncounselors may spend as little as 20-30% of their time on direct student services, with \nsignificant variation depending on school resources and policies. This contrasts with \nelementary-level counselors, who often report a greater focus on direct intervention \nthrough individual and group counseling sessions due to fewer responsibilities outside \nof counseling.\nTypes of Services Delivered\nSecondary school counselors focus on delivering interventions that address both \npreventive and responsive needs. Common interventions include academic advising, \ncareer exploration, college and financial aid counseling, and social-emotional support \ntailored to issues prevalent in adolescence, such as anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and \npeer relationships. Preventive programs in areas such as bullying prevention, stress \nmanagement, and substance abuse are also emphasized in group and classroom \nsettings. In addition to individual counseling, school counselors often provide \nconsultation and collaboration services with teachers, parents, and external providers to \nensure comprehensive support for students.\nEmpirical Outcomes in Intervention Scholarship\nResearch evaluating the outcomes of direct counseling interventions at the secondary \nlevel indicates positive effects on a range of student outcomes. Empirical studies have \nfound that students who engage in structured counseling programs demonstrate \nimprovements in academic performance, attendance, and behavior. Career-focused \ninterventions show positive effects on students' postsecondary planning, vocational \ninterest, and clarity around career pathways. Social-emotional counseling interventions \nhave been associated with reductions in disciplinary incidents, improved emotional \nregulation, and decreased levels of stress and anxiety. Additionally, studies on specific \nintervention approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral techniques and motivational \ninterviewing, have documented their effectiveness in promoting academic engagement, \nresilience, and self-efficacy among high school students.\nIn summary, while secondary school counselors often face barriers to providing high \nquantities of direct counseling services, the interventions they do provide are \nstrategically targeted to address the complex developmental and preparatory needs of \n\nadolescents. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of these interventions, \nhighlighting the value of school counselors\u2019 role in fostering student achievement, \nemotional well-being, and readiness for life beyond high school.\nClassroom \nDelivering classroom guidance and psychoeducational activities using Lemberger-\nTruelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory involves a holistic \napproach that connects students\u2019 individual development with the broader school and \nsocial environment. The school counselor acts as a facilitator who promotes learning \nexperiences that not only focus on the personal growth of students but also emphasize \ntheir role within the educational ecosystem. By using ASE\u2019s foundational principles, the \ncounselor designs activities that reflect the interconnectedness of personal and \nenvironmental factors, fostering an understanding of how these elements shape \nstudents\u2019 academic and social well-being.\nTo implement this, a school counselor might create lessons that incorporate interactive \nactivities, discussions, and role-plays where students can explore topics like executive \nfunctioning, emotional regulation, and social responsibility. These activities should be \nstructured to engage students in self-reflection while simultaneously highlighting the \ninfluence of classroom dynamics, peer relationships, and school culture on their \nexperiences. For example, a counselor could lead a session on stress management that \nincludes identifying personal stress triggers and discussing how cooperative classroom \npractices and supportive peer interactions can contribute to a healthier learning \nenvironment. The approach ensures that students gain insights into their own behaviors \nand emotions while recognizing the reciprocal relationship with their school setting, \npromoting both individual and collective growth.\nUsing Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, a \nschool counselor can effectively deliver Tier 1 activities to students by designing \nuniversal, preventative interventions that acknowledge and incorporate the \ninterconnectedness of students\u2019 individual experiences with their broader school \nenvironment. The ASE theory emphasizes that students\u2019 development and success are \ndeeply influenced by the systems and contexts in which they operate, making it \nessential for school counselors to foster a supportive ecosystem that includes all \naspects of a student's environment.\nDelivery of Tier 1 Activities to Students:\n1. Classroom Guidance Lessons: The school counselor can implement \nclassroom-wide lessons that integrate socio-emotional learning (SEL) with an \nunderstanding of the students\u2019 cultural, social, and academic contexts. For \nexample, lessons on stress management, empathy building, and effective \ncommunication can be tied to real-life situations students face both in school and \nin their communities. The counselor\u2019s role is to highlight how students\u2019 \nrelationships, personal experiences, and the school\u2019s overall climate contribute to \ntheir well-being and academic performance.\n2. School-Wide Initiatives: Counselors can coordinate school-wide activities such \nas mental health awareness weeks, anti-bullying campaigns, or community-\n\nbuilding events that promote a positive school culture. These initiatives should be \ndesigned with the understanding that fostering a sense of belonging and shared \nresponsibility among students supports their overall development and resilience. \nBy creating inclusive and engaging experiences, counselors help students see \ntheir role within the school community and encourage them to build connections \nwith peers and adults.\n3. Workshops and Assemblies: The counselor can lead assemblies or workshops \non themes such as peer support, self-advocacy, and problem-solving. The \ncontent of these activities would be developed with ASE principles in mind, \nemphasizing how students can advocate for themselves and understand the \nsupport systems available to them within their school environment. This \napproach helps students become active participants in their educational journey \nand reinforces the idea that they are part of a larger, caring network.\nKey Aspects:\n\uf0b7\nEmphasis on Environment: The counselor ensures that the activities do not \noccur in isolation but reflect the importance of a supportive environment that \ninvolves teachers, peers, and family members.\n\uf0b7\nStudent Agency: Activities should be designed to empower students to \nrecognize their strengths and understand how to use them to navigate \nchallenges both inside and outside the classroom.\n\uf0b7\nInclusive Practices: Counselors should be mindful of students\u2019 diverse \nbackgrounds and needs, ensuring that all Tier 1 interventions are accessible, \nequitable, and culturally responsive.\nBy embedding ASE theory in Tier 1 activities, the counselor builds a foundation that \nsupports student well-being and development, emphasizing that every student is part of \na dynamic system where mutual advocacy and environmental awareness contribute to \npositive growth.\nSmall Group\nDelivering small group activities using Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-\nEnvironment (ASE) theory requires a school counselor to emphasize both individual \nstudent needs and the broader school context in which they operate. The ASE theory \nsupports the idea that students\u2019 personal experiences and development are influenced \nby and interconnected with their educational environment, including relationships with \npeers and school culture.\nIn practice, the counselor creates small group sessions that foster collaboration, \nsupport, and shared experiences while being attentive to individual strengths and \nchallenges. The activities should incorporate interactive and reflective exercises where \nstudents can discuss personal experiences and recognize the impact of social and \nenvironmental factors. For instance, a group activity focused on enhancing social skills \nmight include role-playing scenarios where students navigate common school-based \nchallenges, such as group projects or peer disagreements. During these activities, the \ncounselor facilitates discussions that connect students' insights with broader themes of \nempathy, respect, and collective responsibility in their school environment.\n\nAdditionally, the counselor might guide the group in identifying common goals, like \ncreating a more inclusive school atmosphere, which reinforces the notion of students \nbeing active contributors to their shared environment. By integrating reflection, \ndiscussion, and skill-building exercises, the counselor ensures that students not only \ndevelop personally but also enhance their understanding of how their behaviors and \nattitudes influence, and are influenced by, their school community.\nUsing Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, \nschool counselors can deliver Tier 2 activities that provide targeted support for students \nwho need additional assistance beyond the universal, preventive measures of Tier 1. \nThis approach prioritizes understanding the student\u2019s experiences within the context of \ntheir environmental systems, such as peers, school staff, and family, and seeks to foster \npositive development and well-being through targeted interventions that strengthen \nthese relationships.\nDelivery of Tier 2 Activities to Students:\n1. Small Group Counseling: A school counselor can conduct small group sessions \nfocused on specific challenges, such as managing anxiety, enhancing social \nskills, or developing coping strategies. These groups should be tailored to \naddress the unique dynamics that students experience in their school \nenvironment. For example, a counselor might facilitate peer discussions where \nstudents can share and learn from one another, reinforcing the supportive \nnetwork within the school. The counselor\u2019s role would include helping students \nrecognize their strengths and empowering them to advocate for themselves in a \nway that acknowledges the supportive resources around them.\n2. Mentorship and Peer Support Programs: The counselor can coordinate \nprograms where students receive mentorship from older peers or trained staff, \ncreating a structured support system that aligns with ASE\u2019s focus on \nenvironment-based advocacy. These programs should highlight how students' \ninteractions within the school community contribute to their growth and resilience. \nThe counselor might guide students to identify positive role models and build \nconnections that help them feel more integrated within their school\u2019s culture.\n3. Skill-Building Workshops: For students who require focused assistance, skill-\nbuilding workshops can be designed to address particular needs such as conflict \nresolution, decision-making, or self-regulation. These workshops should be \nframed within the context of how these skills will help students navigate \nchallenges both in school and at home. The counselor can use ASE theory to \nemphasize that developing these skills not only benefits the individual but also \nimproves their interactions and relationships within the broader school \nenvironment.\nKey Aspects:\n\uf0b7\nContextual Understanding: The counselor works to identify how students\u2019 \ndifficulties are influenced by their interactions with peers, teachers, and family \nmembers, ensuring that interventions take these elements into account.\n\uf0b7\nStrength-Based Perspective: Interventions should focus on what students are \ndoing well and how those strengths can be leveraged within their social and \nschool environments to overcome obstacles.\n\n\uf0b7\nCollaboration with Teachers and Families: The counselor should involve \nteachers and guardians in understanding and supporting the students\u2019 progress. \nThis collaborative approach helps reinforce the interconnected support system \naround the student, which is central to ASE theory.\nBy implementing Tier 2 activities through the lens of ASE theory, school counselors can \nprovide targeted support that respects the student's individual experiences while \nenhancing their ability to thrive within their interconnected school and community \nenvironments.\nIndividual Counseling \nDelivering individual counseling activities using Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating \nStudent-within-Environment (ASE) theory involves a comprehensive approach that \nrecognizes the student as part of a broader ecological system. The school counselor \nemphasizes the student's interconnectedness with their environment, understanding \nthat their personal development is influenced by various social, educational, and cultural \nfactors.\nIn practice, the counselor engages in individual sessions that address personal \nchallenges while considering the broader school context. The counselor might use \ntechniques such as guided discussions that connect the student\u2019s feelings and thoughts \nto their interactions within the school, such as relationships with peers or teachers and \nthe overall school climate. For instance, a counselor could explore how a student's \nstress about academic performance is influenced by school policies, peer competition, \nor familial expectations. By helping the student reflect on these connections, the \ncounselor supports the student in understanding how external factors shape their \nexperiences and responses.\nAdditionally, the counselor can implement strength-based interventions that focus on \nleveraging the student\u2019s inherent capabilities while advocating for changes in their \nenvironment to support positive outcomes. This may include collaborative goal-setting \nthat not only addresses the student\u2019s needs but also fosters their role as an active \nparticipant in enhancing their school environment, reinforcing the ASE theory's \nemphasis on interconnected growth and advocacy. Through these personalized \ncounseling activities, students can develop self-awareness, resilience, and the ability to \nnavigate and contribute meaningfully to their broader school context.\nUsing Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, \nschool counselors can deliver Tier 3 activities to students by providing highly \nindividualized and intensive support that acknowledges and engages with the complex \ninterplay between the student and their environment. This approach emphasizes the \nimportance of understanding how various environmental factors, such as family \ndynamics, peer relationships, and interactions with school personnel, influence the \nstudent's experiences and development.\nDelivery of Tier 3 Activities to Students:\n1. Individualized Counseling Plans: School counselors can create \ncomprehensive, personalized plans that address the specific needs of students \nrequiring Tier 3 interventions. These plans should be informed by an assessment \n\nof the student's academic, social, and emotional needs, while considering how \nexternal factors such as family and community contribute to their challenges. The \ncounselor may collaborate with teachers, parents, and outside mental health \nprofessionals to ensure cohesive support across all environments the student \ninteracts with.\n2. Trauma-Informed Counseling: For students facing significant emotional or \npsychological challenges, a trauma-informed approach aligned with ASE theory \ncan be vital. This method considers the broader context of the student's life, \nensuring that the counselor is aware of any adverse experiences that might \nimpact the student\u2019s behavior and performance in school. By acknowledging \nthese environmental influences, the counselor can help the student develop \ncoping strategies that are sustainable within their school and home \nenvironments.\n3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Counselors delivering Tier 3 interventions \nshould engage with other professionals, such as social workers, school \npsychologists, and special education staff, to create a multidisciplinary support \nnetwork. This aligns with ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on advocating for the student \nwithin all environments that affect their growth. Through consistent \ncommunication and collaborative planning, the counselor ensures that the \nstudent receives a cohesive and integrated support system.\nExample Activities:\n\uf0b7\nIntensive One-on-One Counseling: Sessions focused on deep exploration of \nthe student's experiences, challenges, and strengths, taking into account the \ninfluences of their relationships and broader social context. These sessions help \nthe student build resilience and problem-solving skills tailored to their specific \ncircumstances.\n\uf0b7\nBehavior Intervention Plans (BIP): The counselor collaborates with teachers \nand families to create and implement BIPs that incorporate strategies designed \nto support positive behavioral changes. These plans take into account the \nstudent's interactions in various settings and emphasize reinforcing positive \nbehaviors within the school environment.\n\uf0b7\nCrisis Management Support: When students are experiencing acute issues, \nsuch as family disruption or personal trauma, the counselor provides immediate \nsupport while coordinating with external mental health services to ensure \ncontinuity of care that respects the student\u2019s environmental context.\nKey Aspects:\n\uf0b7\nStudent Advocacy: The counselor acts as an advocate for the student, ensuring \nthat their unique needs are communicated to teachers, administrators, and \ncaregivers, fostering a supportive school environment.\n\uf0b7\nHolistic Understanding: Interventions are grounded in an understanding of how \nvarious systems (family, peers, school climate) contribute to the student's current \nstate and how they can be leveraged for positive change.\n\uf0b7\nEmpowerment and Support: By recognizing the interconnected nature of the \nstudent\u2019s experiences, counselors can empower students to build self-advocacy \nskills, creating a pathway for sustained improvement and engagement with their \nschool community.\n\nTier 3 activities, guided by the principles of ASE theory, ensure that students receive the \npersonalized and contextually aware support they need to thrive academically, socially, \nand emotionally.\nConsultation \nDelivering consultation activities to teachers and guardians using Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s \nAdvocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory involves collaboration that \nemphasizes the interplay between the student\u2019s individual needs and the broader \nschool and home environments. The goal is to align understanding and strategies \namong school staff and guardians to foster a supportive atmosphere that extends \nbeyond individual intervention and into systemic advocacy.\nFor teachers, a school counselor operating within the ASE framework might conduct \nprofessional development sessions or one-on-one consultations to highlight how \nclassroom dynamics, teaching strategies, and school culture impact students\u2019 socio-\nemotional and academic experiences. The counselor would share observations and \ndata-driven insights about how student behaviors may be responses to environmental \nstressors or supports. This helps teachers adopt practices that not only manage \nindividual student needs but also promote an inclusive and developmentally supportive \nclassroom.\nIn consulting with guardians, the counselor would focus on building partnerships that \nrespect cultural, social, and familial influences. This may include organizing workshops \nor meetings where parents and guardians learn about how the school environment \ninteracts with the home and vice versa, supporting shared strategies that promote the \nstudent\u2019s overall well-being. The counselor may guide discussions that emphasize the \nrole of home-school communication in creating consistent support systems, helping \nguardians recognize their influence as part of a collaborative ecosystem aimed at \nstudent growth.\nThroughout these consultations, the counselor would serve as an advocate for aligning \ninterventions that address both personal student growth and environmental factors, \nensuring that efforts from teachers and guardians are synergistic and reflective of the \nstudent\u2019s holistic context.\nAdvocacy\nUsing Lemberger-Truelove\u2019s Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) theory, \nschool counselors can perform advocacy activities that focus on understanding and \nenhancing the interconnected systems affecting a student's life. This theory emphasizes \nthat a student's well-being and success are influenced not just by individual factors but \nby their broader social and environmental contexts. Counselors can advocate effectively \nby addressing systemic barriers and facilitating positive interactions across school, \nfamily, and community environments.\nAdvocacy Activities in the School Context:\n1. Promoting Inclusive Policies: Counselors can work with school administrators \nto develop and implement policies that support diversity, equity, and inclusion. \nThis includes advocating for fair disciplinary practices, culturally responsive \nteaching, and access to mental health resources.\n\n2. Educating Staff: By providing professional development sessions, counselors \ncan educate teachers and staff about the importance of understanding students' \nenvironmental contexts, such as socioeconomic background, family structure, \nand cultural identity, to create a supportive learning atmosphere.\n3. Student Empowerment Programs: Counselors can implement programs that \nencourage students to express their needs and advocate for themselves within \nthe school. This might include peer support groups or leadership training that \nhighlights the importance of community and collective support.\nAdvocacy Activities Beyond the School Context:\n1. Building Community Partnerships: ASE theory suggests that external factors \nplay a crucial role in student development. Counselors can collaborate with local \ncommunity organizations, social services, and mental health agencies to provide \nadditional resources and support for students and their families. These \npartnerships can help create a safety net that extends beyond the school.\n2. Parental and Guardian Engagement: School counselors can advocate for the \ninclusion of parents and guardians in discussions about student progress and \nschool initiatives. By holding workshops, information sessions, or family \ncounseling, counselors help guardians understand their roles within the \neducational ecosystem and empower them to be proactive in supporting their \nchildren.\n3. Policy Advocacy: Counselors can extend their advocacy to district or state-level \neducational policy-making by participating in committees or task forces aimed at \naddressing issues such as funding disparities, access to mental health care, or \neducational equity. This systemic approach aligns with ASE theory\u2019s emphasis on \nsupporting students within their larger environment.\nPractical Examples of Advocacy Statements:\n\uf0b7\nWithin the School: \"Our students thrive when they see themselves represented \nin our curriculum and know their voices matter. I propose we develop \ncollaborative committees involving students, teachers, and parents to foster more \ninclusive school practices.\"\n\uf0b7\nBeyond the School: \"Many of our students face challenges at home that impact \ntheir learning. Partnering with local mental health services and after-school \nprograms can provide essential support. Let\u2019s build these connections to create a \ncommunity where students feel safe and supported both in and outside of \nschool.\"\nKey Principles in Advocacy:\n\uf0b7\nHolistic Viewpoint: ASE theory guides counselors to approach advocacy by \nconsidering how the school, family, and community intersect in a student's life, \nensuring that any advocacy effort is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of \nthese interconnected factors.\n\uf0b7\nSystemic Change: Beyond individual support, effective advocacy includes \nworking towards systemic changes that remove barriers and create opportunities \nfor all students.\n\uf0b7\nEmpowerment and Collaboration: Advocacy efforts should empower students \nand their families and foster collaboration with other stakeholders to reinforce a \nsupportive environment.\n\nThrough these actions, school counselors embody the essence of the ASE theory by \nensuring that students' voices are amplified, their needs are met, and their growth is \nsupported across all spheres of influence.\nBased on the insights derived from the Advocating Student-within-Environment (ASE) \ntheory outlined in the provided text, I will construct 20 novel counseling techniques \ngrounded in the core ASE principles. These techniques will incorporate values such as \ncuriosity, connectedness, co-regulation, compassion, and contribution, with an \nemphasis on fostering students' executive functioning, self-regulation, and identity \ndevelopment.\n1. Guided Perspective Exploration\nTechnique: The counselor asks open-ended questions to help students critically \nevaluate the influences shaping their behavior.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"What do you think influences your decisions the most\u2014your friends, family, \nor school environment?

Strength-Based Identity Mapping\nTechnique: Students create a visual \"identity map\" showing their strengths, challenges, \nand influences from their environment.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"Let\u2019s map out everything that makes you \u2018you.\u2019 What are some personal \nstrengths or experiences you\u2019re proud of? How do these connect with what\u2019s happening \naround you?\"\n3. Co-Regulation through Grounding Techniques\nTechnique: Using mindfulness exercises during moments of distress, the counselor and \nstudent co-regulate by practicing together.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"Let\u2019s try deep breathing together for a moment. Place your hand on your \nstomach and feel it rise as you breathe in. I\u2019ll do it with you.\"\n4.

How can we take the first step to make this happen?\"\n10. Emotional Thermometer\nTechnique: Teach students to use an \"emotional thermometer\" to identify and regulate \ntheir stress levels.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"On a scale of 1 to 10, how overwhelmed do you feel today? What could we \ndo together to bring that number down?\"\n11. Resilience-Building Scenarios\nTechnique: Present hypothetical challenges and guide students to brainstorm coping \nstrategies.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"Imagine you\u2019ve failed an important test. What\u2019s your first reaction? What \ncould you do to bounce back stronger?\"\n12. Contribution Projects\n\nTechnique: Engage students in projects that improve their school or local community, \nreinforcing their sense of purpose.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"What\u2019s one thing you\u2019d like to improve about our school? Let\u2019s brainstorm \nhow you can lead that effort.\"\n13. Executive Functioning Skill Games\nTechnique: Use interactive games to build time management and organizational skills.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"Let\u2019s play a quick game.

Self-Reflection Storytelling\nTechnique: Use storytelling to help students reflect on personal growth.\nExample Dialogue:\nCounselor: \"If you were the main character in a story, how would you describe the \nchapter you\u2019re in right now? What\u2019s next in your journey?\"\nThese techniques align with ASE\u2019s principles, empowering students by addressing both \ntheir internal capacities and the systemic environment. Each technique is adaptable, \nallowing counselors to meet diverse student needs. Would you like further elaboration \non any specific technique?", "Print4.pdf": "Session 1\nCounselor: Hello Emily, what brings you to counseling today?\nClient:  Um, hi. I guess I just feel... well, I'm struggling a lot with school. It\u2019s like, no \nmatter how hard I try, I just can\u2019t keep up with everything. And it\u2019s really frustrating, you \nknow? It's hard to concentrate in class and sometimes I just feel really left behind. \nEveryone else seems to get things so easily, and that kinda makes me feel... rejected \nby my peers too. Like they don\u2019t really want to be around someone who doesn\u2019t \nunderstand stuff as easily as they do.\nCounselor:  You are frustrated because the effort you invest in school doesn't seem to \ntranslate into the outcomes you'd hope for.\nClient:  Uh, yeah, I guess that's kinda close. But it feels more like... like no matter how \nmuch effort I put in, it just seems pointless sometimes. It\u2019s not just frustration; it\u2019s more \nlike this sinking feeling that I'm never going to catch up or be good enough. It\u2019s hard to \nexplain, but it's really draining to feel stuck while everyone else is moving forward. \nCounselor: It is draining emotionally to see others doing well while you are never able to \ncatch up or achieve in the desired way.\nClient: Yeah, that\u2019s sort of what I mean. But it\u2019s not just about not achieving the right \nway; it feels more like I\u2019m... like I'm always on the outside looking in. Like people see me \nstruggling and don\u2019t want to include me because of it. So it's not just tiring; it feels really \nlonely sometimes, you know? \nCounselor:  That must be quite lonely, being on the outside while in the same school \nbuilding with others.\nClient:  Yeah, it really is. I sit in class and see everyone else working together, \nlaughing... I just feel like I'm not part of that. It's like I'm there physically, but \nemotionally? I\u2019m just kinda disconnected. Sometimes it makes me want to just zone out \nor not even be there at all. It\u2019s hard to keep trying when you feel so alone in it.\nCounselor:  It sounds like a cycle.  You see others having fun and learning, whereas \nyou're struggling. And the more that you struggle the further disengaged you become, \nmaking you even further behind.\nClient: Yeah, that\u2019s... um, that\u2019s pretty accurate. But sometimes it feels a little worse \nthan just being disengaged. It's like I can\u2019t even get back into it because the more I fall \nbehind, the more I want to avoid everything. It\u2019s like this heavy weight pulling me down; \nit's not just a cycle but also kind of a trap or something. Ugh, I don\u2019t know\u2026\nCounselor: A trap is something that captures you from the outside and won't let go. \nwonder what things about school trap you?\n\nClient: I guess there are a lot of things that feel like traps. Like, the pressure to keep up \nwith everyone else, or the way some teachers seem to just expect you to understand \neverything right away. And when I don\u2019t get it, it's like... I just feel worse about myself \nand want to disappear, you know? It\u2019s hard not feeling... good enough sometimes. It\u2019s all \njust too much pressure on top of the stress from schoolwork itself. \nCounselor: How long have you been experiencing this type of stress at school?\nClient: Um, I guess it\u2019s been building up for a while... maybe since I started high \nschool? It was tough at first, but now it just feels like it's piling on more and more. Like \neach year brings new challenges that just add to the stress, and sometimes I wonder if \nI'll ever get a break from it all. It\u2019s hard to remember what it felt like before all this \npressure and anxiety about school set in.\nCounselor: You mention the anxiety that you're experiencing, what specific types of \nexperiences in school are related to these feelings of anxiety?\nClient: Well, it's mostly when I'm in class and trying to keep up with the lessons. Like, \nwhen I don\u2019t understand something and my mind starts to race. I get really nervous \nabout answering questions, or even just being called on\u2014it's super embarrassing if I \ncan\u2019t answer right away. Or during tests, I freak out because I feel like everyone else is \nfinishing while I'm still stuck on the first few questions. It\u2019s just... a lot of pressure that \nmakes me feel like everyone is watching and judging me all the time.\nCounselor: Can you describe for me the timeline of the stress. For example, does the \nstress occur when you are assigned something or there is a test, or might it start \nsometimes before?\nClient: Uh, yeah, I think it starts even before we get assigned something or have a test. \nLike, when I hear about a new topic coming up in class or if I know something is due \nsoon, that\u2019s when the anxiety really kicks in. It\u2019s like this shadow looming over me. Then \nas we get closer to the assignment or test date, I stress about how little time I've had to \nprepare or how many things I don\u2019t understand yet. By the time it actually happens, I'm \nalready overwhelmed and just hoping to get through it without making too many \nmistakes. It feels like an endless loop of waiting for.\nCounselor: Once you recognize the experience of stress, how does that affect how you \nprepare for school?\nClient: Um, it kind of messes everything up, to be honest. I know I should probably \nprepare more or ask for help, but when I'm feeling that way, I just freeze up. Sometimes \nI end up procrastinating because the idea of starting makes me more anxious. So \ninstead of studying or working on assignments early, I'll put them off until the last \nminute\u2026 and then it just gets worse. It\u2019s like this cycle\u2014feeling stressed leads to not \npreparing well enough, which makes me stress even more about not being ready. It's \nreally hard to break that pattern.\n\nCounselor: With that amount of stress building up before the content is even \nintroduced in class, it is probably difficult, if not impossible, to even know if you have the \nability to perform well in school. The stress seems to affect you even before the learning \nor performance opportunity begins.\nClient: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s like I\u2019m already defeated before I even get a chance to try. \nWhen that stress builds up beforehand, it makes me doubt myself even more. I can\u2019t \nreally focus on what we\u2019re learning when all those thoughts are running through my \nmind, you know? It's not just about whether I can perform well\u2014it's about feeling like \nthere's this heavy cloud of anxiety following me around all the time. And then when \nthings don\u2019t go well, it just reinforces that feeling of being stuck and not good enough.\nCounselor: Earlier in our conversation, you suggested that it is hard to concentrate and \nothers appear better than you in school and learning. But I wonder if that is fully true, \nbased on what you are now saying about your stress. Might it be that you have a similar \nability to learn, but the stress and anxiety takes you out of the mindset before you even \nhave the opportunity to learn or perform?\nClient: Um, I mean, maybe that's true? But it still feels like everyone else just gets it and \nI don\u2019t. Even if my stress is getting in the way, it\u2019s hard not to feel like I\u2019m falling behind. \nIt\u2019s like... even on days when I think I might do okay, that anxiety kicks in and takes me \nout of the moment. So yeah, there might be something there about my ability to learn \nbeing affected by stress... but sometimes it just feels like I'm not even on the same level \nas others. It's complicated.\nCounselor: I get that it is complicated and certainly it is painful. Yet if we try and look at \nwhat you're experiencing a bit differently -- that is, focus on the stress rather than jump \nto the conclusion that you are not able to perform like others -- there might be new \npossible outcome.\nClient: I guess... that could be a new way to look at it. But it\u2019s hard for me to switch my \nmindset like that when I\u2019ve been feeling this way for so long. It's like, even if the stress is \na big part of it, all I see are the grades and how much I'm struggling compared to others. \nIt feels overwhelming sometimes, like I can\u2019t help but think about how far behind I am \ninstead of focusing on what might improve things. It\u2019s not easy to change my \nperspective when I'm in that moment of anxiety and doubt, you know?\nCounselor: Yeah, it is really hard to change, especially if you have felt this way for a \nlong time. Maybe we could also have a different perspective on that too. If you are \nlooking for change to occur that is similar in duration as the amount of time you have \nstruggled, it might make it harder for you to notice small and yet important changes.\nClient: Um, I guess that makes sense? Like, if I'm expecting big changes right away \nafter feeling this way for so long, I might just get even more frustrated. But it's still hard \nto see those small changes when everything feels so overwhelming all the time. I want \n\nto feel better and improve, but sometimes it seems like it's going to take forever or like \nI'm stuck at square one. It\u2019s just... a lot to think about while I'm already feeling anxious \nabout everything else.\nCounselor: Yeah, we don't want to add more anxiety to your current anxiety. But as you \nsaid, your anxiety seemed to be inevitable anyway. Might it be better to try a new \nstrategy if anxiety is inevitable?\nClient: I mean, yeah, maybe trying a new strategy could be helpful. But I guess part of \nme is just unsure about what to even try. I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up and then feel \nlet down again if it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s like, I know anxiety is going to be there, but figuring \nout what new things might help me deal with it just sounds... challenging? I'm not really \nsure where to start with that or if anything will actually make a difference.\nCounselor: What would be something meaningful to you to risk trying something new?\nClient: I think it would be meaningful to try something that might help me feel more \nconfident in myself, maybe? Like, if there was some way to build my skills without the \npressure of being compared to others or worrying about grades, that could help. A \nsmaller step where I could focus on understanding one thing at a time might make a \ndifference. I just want to feel like I can actually learn and not get overwhelmed right \naway. But... actually taking that risk feels kinda scary too.\nCounselor: Do you have any evidence that others are comparing themselves to you? \nClient: Um, not really evidence, I guess. It\u2019s mostly just how I feel. Like when I'm in \nclass and I see people talking or laughing together while I'm struggling to keep up, it just \nmakes me think they must be comparing themselves to me or seeing me as lesser \nsomehow. But maybe that\u2019s all in my head? It\u2019s hard to shake off those feelings when \nthey come up, you know? \nCounselor: So you are doing the comparison and they may or may not being \ncomparing themselves with you?\nClient: Yeah, I think that's probably true. It\u2019s just... easier to assume they\u2019re judging me \nwhen I\u2019m already feeling so low about myself. But really, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re \nthinking. Maybe it\u2019s just me putting that pressure on myself and not understanding that \neveryone has their own struggles, too. It feels a little silly now that I'm saying it out loud, \nbut it's hard to change how deeply those feelings run inside of me.\nCounselor: You assume that they are judging you because you are judging you.\nClient: I guess that makes sense. I\u2019m super hard on myself, and maybe that\u2019s why I \nthink others are too. It's like, if I feel not good enough, it's easy to project that onto them \nand think they feel the same way about me. But recognizing that doesn\u2019t make it any \n\neasier to let go of the anxiety or those feelings of being judged, you know? It\u2019s \nfrustrating because I want to break free from all this pressure but don\u2019t really know how.\nCounselor: I wonder if there is a relationship between the anxiety that you are feeling \nand the judgments about yourself that you make?\nClient: Uh, yeah, I think there probably is a connection. The more I feel anxious about \nnot doing well or keeping up, the harsher I am on myself. It\u2019s like one fuels the other. If \nI'm nervous about an assignment or a test, my brain starts saying things like \u201cyou\u2019re not \nsmart enough\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll fail,\u201d and that just makes it all worse. It\u2019s kind of a cycle that \nfeeds into itself, which makes it feel even harder to break free and just try to relax for \nonce.\nCounselor: I don't know if that's true; while it is hard to break free from anxiety but \ncontinuing to live this the anxiety seems pretty challenging too.\nClient: Um, I mean, yeah, it's definitely challenging. It just feels like I'm stuck in this \nendless cycle where no matter what I do, I still end up feeling anxious and not good \nenough. Honestly, it can feel really overwhelming to think about trying to break free \nwhen I'm so used to living with that anxiety every day. Sometimes it feels safer to stay in \nmy comfort zone of feeling anxious rather than risk trying something new and possibly \nfailing at it.\nCounselor: You say that it is safer to stay in your comfort zone, yet you are describing \nanxiety and judgment in a way that doesn't sound comfortable.\nClient: Yeah, I see what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s not really comfortable at all\u2014it\u2019s just familiar. \nEven if it feels overwhelming and heavy, it\u2019s something I know how to deal with, in a \nweird way. Trying to step out of that might mean facing even more uncertainty and fear, \nwhich is intimidating. But I guess what you're pointing out makes me think that maybe \nstaying in my comfort zone isn\u2019t as safe as I thought. That kind of makes me want to run \naway from the conversation a bit\u2026\nCounselor: Sometimes coming to these realizations about ourselves can be \nchallenging. Let's try and hold on for just a few minutes or more. If the anxiety gets to be \ntoo much, we will use that as a lesson to teach us about your ways of dealing with \nstress.\nClient: Um, okay... I\u2019ll try my best to hold on. But I can feel the anxiety creeping back in \nalready. It\u2019s hard to talk about this stuff without feeling like I just want to disconnect from \nit all. I guess if we\u2019re going to use this moment as a learning experience, that could help \nme understand more about my stress and how it affects me? But, honestly, it\u2019s still \npretty tough for me.\nCounselor: You say that it is challenging, but I want to applaud you, as you've done an \nincredible job of describing yourself and your feelings with me today.\n\nClient: Oh, um, thanks. I appreciate you saying that. It\u2019s nice to hear some praise since \nI often feel like I\u2019m not doing anything right at school or anywhere else. But... it does \nalso feel a little weird to accept that kind of acknowledgment? Like, maybe I should be \ndoing more or achieving something bigger before hearing compliments. But thanks, \nanyway\u2014it helps a bit, even if it\u2019s hard for me to fully accept right now.\nCounselor: You mention the word acceptance.  That is a powerful word.  It is kind of \nthe opposite of judgment, a word we talked about before. \nClient: Yeah, it really is. Acceptance feels like it could make things a bit easier\u2014like \nrecognizing where I am right now without that harsh judgment on myself. But it's tough \nto feel accepted when I'm so used to judging myself based on how I compare to others \nor what I think success looks like. If acceptance is the opposite of judgment, then \nmaybe that's something I really need to work on... figuring out how to be okay with \nwhere I'm at instead of constantly pushing for perfection or feeling not good enough. It\u2019s \njust hard to switch gears in my mind sometimes.\nCounselor: Yes, it is hard.  But as you said before, it might be harder because of the \nexpectation of perfection or expectations in how you compare yourself to others.  I \nwonder if we make acceptance more manageable. \nClient: Hmm, I guess if we could make acceptance more manageable, it might help me \nfeel less pressure. Maybe breaking it down into smaller steps or focusing on little things \nI can accept about myself could be a start? Like recognizing small achievements or \nsimply acknowledging that it's okay to struggle sometimes. But that sounds easier said \nthan done\u2026 It\u2019s just hard when I\u2019m so used to being critical of myself.\nCounselor: You've already done it in our conversation now.  You have accepted the \npossibility of accepting small bits of yourself.  \nClient: Yeah, I guess I have started to think about it that way. It feels kind of nice to \nrealize that maybe I can take those small steps toward acceptance instead of just \nfeeling overwhelmed all the time. It's still tough for me\u2014I mean, I worry how long it'll \ntake for those feelings to really settle in and feel real. But maybe it\u2019s a good first step? \nThanks for pointing that out; it helps me see things from a different angle.\nCounselor: You are doing it again, jumping to the end and comparing your immediate \naccomplishments to what you have not yet accomplished in the distant future. \nClient: Yeah, I see what you mean. I guess it\u2019s just how my mind works\u2014I keep \njumping ahead to what I haven\u2019t done yet instead of just focusing on what I've done right \nnow. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t help but think about the end goal instead of appreciating the small \nsteps I'm taking. That\u2019s something I really need to work on\u2026 trying to be present in this \nmoment rather than getting lost in thoughts about where I want to be or worrying about \nhow long it will take to get there.\n\nCounselor: Let's come back and deeply honor what you have done today. You are \naccepting that you experience anxiety, you are accepting your habit to jump to judgment \nand perfectionism, and you have also accepted that keeping things small make you feel \na small bit more relieved. \nClient: Thank you for saying that. It feels nice to hear it's being honored, even if it\u2019s \nhard for me to really accept it myself right now. Recognizing those things today feels like \na step\u2014like I\u2019m starting to see that I can work on my anxiety and how I judge myself \ninstead of just feeling stuck all the time. It\u2019s still a lot, but maybe holding onto these \nsmall victories is what will help me make progress? That feels... kind of hopeful, which \nis nice for a change.\nCounselor: One of my teachers say to me, \"little by little, bit by bit, I am improving \neveryday.\"  \nClient: I like that saying! It feels encouraging to think about improvement as a gradual \nprocess instead of something that needs to happen all at once. Little by little definitely \nsounds more manageable and realistic for me, especially with everything I\u2019ve been \nfeeling. I\u2019ll try to remember that\u2014focusing on just making small progress each day \nrather than expecting huge changes right away. Thanks for sharing that; it\u2019s a nice \nreminder!\nCounselor: Today you started with a new possibility.  Maybe there is something small \nand yet equally meaningful that you could try once you leave our appointment? \nClient: Um, yeah, I think I could try to do something small that feels manageable. \nMaybe I could set a little goal for myself, like taking just 10 minutes to review some \nmaterial in a way that feels less pressured? Or maybe I could write down a couple of \nthings I\u2019ve done well this week instead of focusing on what went wrong. It doesn't seem \ntoo overwhelming, and it might help me build that sense of acceptance we talked about. \nThanks for helping me see that there\u2019s potential for small steps\u2014I really appreciate it.\nCounselor: That sounds like a potentially helpful goal.  Can you touch base later this \nweek and see how it went?  \nClient: Uh, yeah, I think that would be good. It\u2019d be nice to check in and see how it went \nor if I even managed to stick with those small goals. Honestly, just having that support \nfeels helpful\u2014as much as I worry about failing or not measuring up, knowing someone \nis there makes it feel a little less daunting. So yeah, let\u2019s touch base later this week! \nThanks for being here for me today.\nCounselor: Thank you for your courage.  I am genuinely excited to hear about your \nefforts.  See you later this week. \nClient: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I\u2019ll do my best to try those small steps, \nand I'm looking forward to sharing how it goes. See you later this week!\n\nSession Two\nCounselor: It is good to see you again, I am excited to hear if you were able to try out \nthe strategies of non-judgment we discussed or if there are any new happenings that \nyou'd like to talk about instead. \nClient: Um, hey. I guess it's good to see you too... I didn't really get a chance to try out \nthose non-judgment strategies, though. School's just been really overwhelming lately, \nyou know? It's like I\u2019m still stuck in the same spot and \u2013 ugh \u2013 everyone else is moving \nahead without me. Sometimes it feels like when I'm struggling in class, my classmates \njust notice and... I don\u2019t know. It makes me feel kind of rejected or invisible, like I'm just \nnot part of it all. Maybe we can talk about that? \nCounselor: Yes, that sounds like a perfect place to pick back up.  I do want to \ncommend you though, as last time we spoke you were a little cautious and skeptical at \nthe beginning and then you started to get more motivated and optimistic that growth can \noccur; whereas today you seem to be ready to talk from the outset. \nClient: I mean\u2026 I guess it\u2019s good that you noticed I'm here and talking, but it doesn\u2019t \nreally feel like I\u2019m more motivated or optimistic. It still feels hard to keep up, and I just \nfeel bad about falling behind. Like, even if I talk to you today, it doesn't change how \nthings are going in class. I don't know... maybe I'm just not as ready as you think? But \nthanks for saying something anyway. \nCounselor: Change is very difficult.  For example, let's consider how long you've \nexperienced these challenges.  If I recall correctly, you mentioned years, whereas this \nnewfound perspective is less than a week old.  \nClient: Yeah, I guess that's true. It has been a long time, like forever. But it still feels \nkind of weird to think about it that way. Like just because I'm trying to change my \nthoughts doesn't mean everything is magically better overnight, you know? \nSometimes I feel like people expect me to just get over it or something. It's not that \nsimple... but whatever. I don\u2019t really want to keep talking about this if it's just going back \nand forth like last time. \nCounselor: It sounds like we are in agreement, no changing overnight is expected of \nyou.  Last time we talked about small changes and you were quite encouraged by that \npossibility. \nClient: Um, yeah, I guess I mentioned being okay with small changes? But honestly\u2026 it \nfeels like those \u201csmall changes\u201d are still so far away. It\u2019s hard to stay encouraged when I \nsee everyone else in class just understanding stuff while I'm still trying to catch up. So, I \ndon\u2019t know... it doesn't feel like anything has really changed since we last talked. Maybe \nit's just too much pressure or... whatever. Can we talk about something else? \n\nCounselor: We can talk about anything that you like, yet what you mentioned before is \nthat your anxiety affects most everything in your life.  If that is true, what could we \npossibly talk about that is not affected by the anxiety? \nClient: I don't know\u2026 I mean, I guess everything is a bit affected by it, but maybe we \ncould talk about, like, what I like to do in my free time or something? It's not all bad. \nSometimes I just want to escape and forget about the classes and the pressure...  I\u2019ve \nbeen watching some shows that help me relax or get lost in some music. Just not think \nabout all this stuff for a while would be nice. Can we go there instead? \nCounselor: That's a great idea, but I cannot promise that talking about things that \nreduce your anxiety is not in some way relevant to helping you make small \naccomplishments in your emotional growth. \nClient: Um, okay, I get that you're trying to link everything back to the anxiety stuff. But \nsometimes it feels like you think too much about it? Like, can\u2019t we just talk about \nsomething without trying to connect it all back?  I don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe I\u2019m just tired of \ngoing in circles and I just want a break from labels or whatever. It\u2019s hard enough as it is. \nIf we could...just focus on the fun things for a bit maybe?\n \nCounselor: Okay, let's start with what brings you the greatest sense of peace. \nClient: Um, I guess when I'm in my room just listening to music or watching my favorite \nshows? It just feels nice to be able to zone out and not think about schoolwork or \nanything else. Sometimes I feel like I can breathe again in those moments. It\u2019s like \neverything else falls away, you know? But then when it\u2019s over, it hits me that I have all \nthese things waiting for me. So yeah\u2026 maybe that's what brings me peace, but also a \nlittle anxiety... Sorry if that sounds confusing.\nCounselor: No need to apologize.  It doesn't sound confusing at all.  It is normal.  In \nfact, almost all people who experience peace also feel some anxiety, even if the peace \nand anxiety comes from the same experience or activity. \nClient: Um, okay, I guess... But it kind of feels like you're saying that everyone deals \nwith this and it's just normal? That\u2019s not really what I meant. Like, for me, it feels heavy \nand different. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just a bit more messed up than everyone \nelse or something.  I don\u2019t know if that helps explain how I'm feeling? It's like it's nice to \nfind peace in those moments, but the anxiety just creeps back in and makes everything \nfeel harder again... Can we go back to talking about music or something? \nCounselor: I think you are right, there are definitely differences in how people \nexperience things, be it peace or anxiety.  What I am suggesting is that we all \nexperience it, but what seems to make things difference across people is the amount of \npeace or anxiety. \n\nClient: Yeah, I get that you\u2019re trying to make sense of it, but it still feels like you\u2019re just \nsaying what everyone else would say. Like yeah, some people have different levels of \nanxiety or peace, but I guess\u2014it's hard for me because sometimes it feels like no one \nreally understands how bad mine gets. \nI don\u2019t know... I just feel kind of drained talking about it this way. Can we keep this part \nlighter? It\u2019s exhausting thinking about how to measure everything. \nCounselor: Sometimes resistance is a way of testing if someone is safe.  You \nacknowledge that I am trying to make sense of your experiences, but at the same time \nyou are saying that no one really understands.  I have learned a lot about you, and I \nwonder how that affects you? \nClient: I mean... I guess it\u2019s nice that you say you\u2019ve learned a lot about me, but \nhonestly it feels like I\u2019m still trying to figure out my own experiences too. And I don\u2019t \nknow if saying \u201cno one understands\u201d means anything specific about you or anyone else, \nit just sucks feeling that way.\nIt's just hard to open up when I feel like I'm not being really heard or understood. Like \nmaybe what I'm going through is different enough that talking doesn\u2019t actually help? I'm \nkind of losing interest in this conversation... can we move on?\nCounselor: Certainly, I am trying to get to know you better.  What do you suggest would \nbe a way to get to know you?\nClient: I don\u2019t know... maybe ask about the stuff I really like? Like, talking about music \nor shows, things that make me laugh or help me forget about everything else for a bit. \nThose are more fun topics to dive into. \nIt\u2019s just easier, you know? When we\u2019re not focusing on all the struggles and can talk \nabout what brings me joy instead... it feels more genuine that way. So what do you want \nto know about those things? \nCounselor: Can you tell me about those first moments of joy you experience when \ndiving into these activities?\nClient: Um... okay, I guess. So like, when I first put on my headphones and hit play on a \nfavorite song or show, there's this rush of relief that hits me. It feels like everything else \njust fades away for a little while, you know? \nThe music can really wrap around me, almost like a cozy blanket. It\u2019s nice to feel \nsomething different than all the stress from school and stuff. Or when I\u2019m watching a \nshow and it starts off funny or exciting\u2014it's like I can breathe again! \nBut then... sometimes it also makes me sad when it's over because I'm back to reality \nfeeling all weighed down again. So yeah, that\u2019s kind of how those moments feel for me \nat the start anyway...\n\nCounselor: You mention breathing when you listen to music.  Can you describe how \nyour breathing is different when listening to music compared to how you breath \nnormally, or even how you breath when you're feeling anxious?\nClient: Um, well... when I\u2019m listening to music, my breathing feels deeper and more \nrelaxed, I guess? Like I'm not holding my breath or trying to push out all these thoughts. \nBut normally, especially when I\u2019m anxious, it's like I'm barely breathing at all. It feels \nshallow and quick \u2014 like I'm just trying to get through it but can't catch a break. \nSometimes I end up feeling light-headed or like I'm drowning in everything that's \nhappening around me.\nSo yeah... music helps make it feel easier\u2014just for those moments\u2014until the anxiety \ncomes back again. It really is kind of a rollercoaster... \nCounselor: Emily, this is a potentially profound realization.  Just like when we spoke \nbefore, you had a deep insight about your anxiety, and I think you might be onto \nsomething again here.  There is a relationship between your breath and your feelings of \nanxiety. \nClient: Um, I guess that makes sense? But honestly, it kind of feels like you're putting a \nlot on me to figure out this relationship stuff. Like yes, I know when I'm listening to \nmusic, my breathing is better! But that doesn't really change how hard things are overall \nor make everything magically easier all the time.\nIt just feels like those connections you\u2019re bringing up can be overwhelming sometimes. I \ndon't want to feel pressured to find patterns or meanings right now. Can we chill a bit on \nthat and just talk about something else?\nCounselor: That's fair, but I do want to remind you that earlier you indicated that it is \ndifficult to find even small goals to work on.  I wonder if maybe you have found that \nsmall goal to work on - attending and regulating your breathing.  This doesn't require \nyou to force things to \"magically\" get easier; just one small thing and notice how it \naffects your feelings.  \nClient: I mean, I see what you're saying, but it still sounds like... a lot? Like, are you \ntrying to turn everything into a lesson again? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to focus on my \nbreathing as some goal or whatever. \nHonestly, it feels exhausting thinking about goals when I'm just trying to get through \neach day without feeling so overwhelmed. Can't we just talk about what makes me feel \ngood again? That feels easier than trying to tackle something that's just going to add \nmore pressure on me. \nCounselor: You're right, more pressure on you is not the goal.  Maybe I was a bit \nhopeful that breathing might be something very convenient.  We don't have to make a \ngoal of breathing.  We just do it.  But the quality of our breath is something we might be \nable to influence.  \n\nClient: Okay, I get it. You\u2019re trying to make it sound like something simple, but it still \nfeels complicated to me. It\u2019s hard not to feel pressured when we're talking about \n\"influencing\" anything, especially with all the other stuff going on in my head.\nI just want to... you know, enjoy some parts of life without feeling like I have to analyze \neverything. It gets tiring when we keep going back and forth on these deeper topics. \nCan we just take a break from all this for now?\nCounselor: again, you impress me with your insights. You said, \"especially with all of \nthe other stuff going on in my head.\"  I get that focusing on breathing would be tough \nwhen you're being influenced by the other stuff in the head.  Maybe that is something to \nconsider, when those other things come to mind, and they feel overwhelming, just \nbreath... and do what you are asking me to do in this conversation, make the moment \nlighter. \nClient: Um, thanks for saying that? But I don\u2019t know\u2026 it still feels like you're sort of \ntelling me what to do again. Like, yeah I get that breathing could be helpful, but it also \nfeels like another thing I have to manage in my head when I already feel overloaded.\nIt\u2019s just... hard for me to focus on lighter things when it seems like we keep returning to \nthe serious topics. Can we talk about something fun? Like shows or music or anything \nelse? Maybe just a little break from this whole mental juggling act? \nCounselor: I cannot promise that I won't continue to be impressed with your insights \nand how they might relate to your approach to anxiety; but I do think that you are right, \nmaybe if we talk about the things that provide you some moment of lesser anxiety here, \nthen it is possible that it can translate over. \nClient: Okay, I appreciate that you see my insights or whatever. It\u2019s just, I really want to \nfocus on things that make me feel good instead of digging into how it all connects to \nanxiety and breathing again. \nSo... let\u2019s talk about music! What are some of your favorite shows or songs? Maybe I \ncan share some of mine too. That sounds more enjoyable right now! \nCounselor: How about you start, what engages you? \nClient: Alright, cool. Lately, I\u2019ve been really into this show on Netflix called \u201cEverything \nSucks!\u201d It\u2019s a bit nostalgic since it\u2019s set in the 90s or whatever. I just love how relatable \nthe characters are and how they deal with all their high school drama. It makes me \nlaugh a lot and reminds me that everyone has their struggles, even if they seem way \nmore put together than me.\nAnd music-wise, I can\u2019t stop listening to Olivia Rodrigo's songs! They hit hard about \nfeelings and stuff... it's nice finding someone who gets all that teenage angst while \nmaking awesome tunes. How about you? What shows or music do you like?\nCounselor: There is a bit of a theme between that show and Rodrigo's lyrics, which \ndoes seem to reflect your current personal experiences.  For me it is the same, I like \n\nmusic and shows that seem to capture what I am experiencing or what I am interested \nin; mostly shows and music about how people experience themselves and the world. \nClient: Yeah, for sure! That\u2019s what makes those shows and songs so relatable. They \nreally capture the ups and downs of being in high school, which is kind of comforting \nsometimes. Like even though I feel like I'm struggling a lot, seeing characters go \nthrough similar stuff can help me feel less alone in it all.\nIt\u2019s nice to find something that reflects what I\u2019m feeling instead of just putting on a \nfacade all the time. But anyway\u2026 do you have any favorite songs or shows that you \nconnect with? I'd love to hear about them!\nCounselor: You mention how they make you feel less like you're alone in these \nexperiences, which I think is true.  It is an older song, but what you said reminds me of a \nsong from the 90s by a group called REM and the title was \"everybody hurts.\" \nClient: Oh yeah! I\u2019ve heard that song before. It\u2019s really powerful, for sure. The message \nabout how we all go through tough times resonates so much. It\u2019s nice to have \nsomething that reminds you it\u2019s okay to feel sad sometimes and that others are dealing \nwith their own stuff too.\nThat kind of comfort goes a long way, right? Sometimes I just sing along to songs like \nthat and feel like I'm part of something bigger than just my own problems. It's soothing \nin a way... thanks for bringing it up! Do you have other songs from back then that speak \nto you?\nCounselor: I am starting to notice a pattern. Emily, while you indicate to me that you \ndon't want me to offer possible connections, I do note that you consistently offer \nbeautiful insights about your life and inner world; yet it seems easier when we cover \nthem in songs or shows. \nClient: I mean, I guess I can see that? It\u2019s definitely easier for me to talk about my \nfeelings through the lens of music or shows. They just create this buffer, you know? It \nfeels less direct and less... heavy to just connect through something already made.\nBut when it comes down to talking about my own stuff directly, it feels way more intense. \nYou know what I mean? So yeah, if talking about songs helps me open up a bit without \nfeeling too exposed, then maybe that's why it's easier for me. \nBut still... can we keep focusing on those fun topics instead of veering back into deeper \nanalysis? I\u2019m just trying to keep it light right now!\nCounselor: It does make me more connected to you, understanding how your world \nworks.  And I hear you asking me about my favorite shows and music; which might \nindicate that you also want to understand my perspective too.  \nClient: Yeah, I guess that\u2019s true. I\u2019m just trying to find common ground, you know? It \nmakes the conversation feel easier and less intense if we can relate to each other \nthrough stuff we both like. Plus, hearing about your perspective might give me \nsomething new to enjoy! \n\nIt feels less like it\u2019s all about my struggles then. So... what are some things you \ngenuinely enjoy? You mentioned before liking shows and music related to \nexperiences\u2014I'd love to hear your faves too!\nCounselor: We are definitely learning about each other.  And I hope to pick this up \nagain soon.  Would you like to schedule a time to talk again in the next few days? \nClient: Um, yeah... I think that could be good. It\u2019s nice to have an open space to talk \nabout lighter stuff and even some deeper things too, but it definitely feels like a lot \nsometimes. So having a set time could help me prepare myself.\nMaybe we can plan for a few days from now? That way I can think about some more fun \ntopics or shows to share!\nCounselor: Sounds good.  I look forward to hearing about them and learning more \nabout you.  In the meantime, without it becoming something too intense or effortful, \nflatter me and do take a minute or two and try and attend to your breathing and see how \nit might affect your feelings.  \nClient: Okay, I can do that. Thanks for suggesting something light like that at the end! \nI'll try to take a moment just to breathe and see what happens... even if it's just for a few \nminutes.\nAnd, um, by the way, I appreciate you being understanding during our talk today. It does \nmake me feel more comfortable sharing things with you, so thanks for being cool about \nit. \nI'll focus on breathing and hopefully catch some of those lighter feelings before we chat \nagain next time!\nCounselor: See you soon. \nClient: See you soon! Take care!\nSession 3\nCounselor: Hello, Emily, it is great to see you again.  Last time we talked about some of \nthe things you do that bring you peace, like music and shows you watch.  We also \nadded talked about how breathing in an intentional manner can also bring momentary \nrelief.  Would you like to start here or with something else? \nClient: Hi... um, yeah, I guess we can start with that. Music and shows are definitely my \ngo-to for when I'm feeling stressed. It\u2019s just easier to escape into those worlds. \nBreathing stuff is kind of... interesting? But sometimes it feels awkward trying to focus \non that when everything around me feels so loud and crazy. \nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really ready to dive deep today though... Just thinking about how \nheavy things can get makes me anxious. Can we keep it more light? Maybe talk about \nsome new music or something? \n\nCounselor: Sure. Maybe you can tell me about some of the feelings you experience \nwhen listening to some of this new music. \nClient: Um, I don\u2019t know... it kind of varies? Like, when I listen to Olivia Rodrigo, her \nsongs really hit hard sometimes. It\u2019s like she gets how confusing everything is\u2014like \nfeeling left out or not understanding things in class. But then there's this sense of relief \ntoo? It\u2019s like I'm not alone in feeling that way. \nBut honestly, if we get too deep into feelings, it just makes me feel more overwhelmed. I \nguess... I just want to keep it lighter for now? You know what I mean?\nCounselor: Olivia Rodrigo seems to be able to touch on that delicate experience of \nconfusion, feelings of loneliness; there is something about it being set to music that \nmakes it less overwhelming, maybe compared to talking about it directly like we've been \ndoing? \nClient: Yeah, kind of. But I mean, it's not just \"less overwhelming.\" It's more like music \ngives me a way to just feel those things without having to talk about them. When I listen, \nI'm in my own little world where I don't have to explain anything or feel judged. Talking \nabout it directly makes everything seem heavier and... ugh, I don\u2019t know... easier to get \nlost in my thoughts.\nI shouldn\u2019t need pressuring feelings every time we talk right? Just listening is good \nenough for me sometimes... It\u2019s easier that way.\nCounselor: What would you like for me to hear you say? \nClient: Um, I guess I just want you to hear that sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to talk about \nmy feelings. I need space, and... maybe reassurance that it's okay not to dive deep \nevery time. I like when it feels easy and chill, you know? It helps me feel less anxious.\nI\u2019m just trying to figure everything out without added pressure, so if we can keep things \nmore relaxed, that would be really nice. \nCounselor: You want someone to share in the feelings of peace you crave.  You don't \nwant to be forced to feel overwhelmed. \nClient: Yeah, that\u2019s close, but it\u2019s not just about sharing. It\u2019s more like... I want to feel \ncomfortable and not have everything be so heavy all the time. I don\u2019t want to be pushed \ninto feeling overwhelmed like it\u2019s expected of me. \nJust chilling and enjoying things without going deep into feelings is what helps me cope \nbetter, you know? Sometimes I feel like... like if we get too far in there, I'll just... check \nout or something. \nCounselor: Maybe to help me out, you can let me know what is your typical tipping \npoint when it gets too intense? \n\nClient: I guess when it feels like we\u2019re spending too long digging into heavy stuff \nwithout breaks... that's when I start to feel really anxious. Like, my mind starts racing \nand it\u2019s hard to focus on anything else. \nIf I feel like we're just going deeper and deeper without any lighthearted moments, I just \nkind of zone out or just want to escape the conversation entirely. It\u2019s almost like my \nbrain hits a limit, and then... ugh, it gets frustrating. So yeah, keeping things balanced \nbetween fun and serious is what helps me the most. \nCounselor: Cool. Make sense. We have established that talking about too much deep \nand serious stuff can be overwhelming, so maybe we can also establish the other end \nof the continuum, what are the things that bring you the fun and peace you crave? \nClient: Um, definitely music, like I said. And shows\u2014like *Everything Sucks!* is really \nrelatable and funny in a way that just makes me feel better. I love getting lost in those \ncharacters and stories because they\u2019re kind of like... real-life situations but just done \ndifferently, you know? \nHanging out with my close friends can be nice too, especially when we talk about \nrandom stuff or share memes\u2014just laughing together feels good. So yeah, anything \nthat gives me that light feeling instead of stress helps a lot! \nCounselor: What can you tell me about your friends? \nClient: Uh, well, I have a few close friends, and they\u2019re kind of my go-to people when I \njust want to hang out. We usually talk about music or the latest shows we're into and \njust joke around a lot. It feels good to be able to relax with them without any pressure.\nBut sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not totally included in everything because of my struggles... \nLike when they understand class stuff easily, and I'm sitting there feeling lost. It can feel \nlonely even when they\u2019re around. But we still have fun together most of the time! \nCounselor: They are kind of like the music you described earlier.  The music can have \na deep feeling but it doesn't overwhelm you because you can listen on your terms.  With \nyour friends, there can be some things that are overwhelming but there is a rhythm that \ngoes along with just hanging out and having fun. \nClient: Yeah, I guess that\u2019s kind of it! My friends can be like that rhythm\u2014a nice flow \nwhere we just enjoy each other\u2019s company without too much pressure. It feels safe and \neasy, so I can just be myself without worrying too much about school stuff or anything \nheavy. \nBut... it's definitely a balancing act. Sometimes I still feel left out of conversations if \nthey\u2019re talking about things I don\u2019t get or understand well enough. So while it\u2019s good \nmost of the time, there are moments where that anxiety creeps in again\u2014especially \nwhen it feels like everyone is on a different page than me.\nCounselor: I imagine that that feels quite isolating. \n\nClient: Yeah, it really does sometimes. Just sitting there, feeling like I\u2019m on the outside \nlooking in can be really tough. Like, I want to connect with them and laugh, but when \nschool stuff comes up and I can\u2019t relate... it\u2019s a reminder of how different things feel for \nme.\nIt makes me anxious about how others see me too\u2014like they might think I'm not trying \nhard enough or something. It\u2019s just... isolating fades into that awkwardness where I don't \nknow what to say or how to fit in anymore. \nCounselor: Have you ever let them know about what you're experiencing inside? \nClient: Uh, not really. I mean, I want to but... it\u2019s hard to find the right words. I don't want \nthem to feel sorry for me or make things awkward. Plus, it's like... if I open up about \nfeeling confused or left out, what if they don't get it? \nMost of the time, I just try to keep things light and pretend that everything's okay. It feels \nsafer that way\u2014like if we keep laughing and avoiding the heavy stuff, maybe it\u2019ll stay \nfun. But then I end up feeling more alone when I'm quiet about what I'm actually going \nthrough. \nCounselor: I imagine that that can be disappointing and lonely; not knowing the right \nwords and therefore feeling close but yet afar from these friends you care about? \nClient: Yeah, that really is it. It\u2019s disappointing because I do care about them, and I want \nto feel close, but not having the right words just makes it harder to connect. It's like \nthere\u2019s this invisible wall between us that I can\u2019t break down, and it feels lonely knowing \nI can't share what I'm really feeling.\nI see them laughing and joking, and then there's me trying to keep up but also feeling \nlost inside. Sometimes it's frustrating... It makes me wish things were easier so we could \nall just understand each other better without having to worry about all this other stuff.\nCounselor: What type of things would you want to say if you could? \nClient: Um, I guess I\u2019d want to say that sometimes I feel really lost in class and it\u2019s hard \nfor me to keep up. Like, even when everyone seems to get it, I'm just... struggling in my \nown head. I'd probably tell them that it's frustrating not being able to express what I'm \nfeeling because I'm afraid of ruining the fun.\nMaybe I'd explain how helpful their support would be if they understood where I was \ncoming from but also let them know that it\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t always dive into heavy stuff \ntoo! Just finding a balance would be really good. \nCounselor: And what might you feel if you heard them respond to you in a way that you \ndesire? \nClient: If they responded in a way that I hoped for, like being really understanding and \nsupportive, I think I'd feel... relieved? Like it would take a huge weight off my shoulders \nto know they actually get where I'm coming from. \nIt would make me feel less lonely and more accepted, you know? Just hearing them say \nsomething like \"it's okay to struggle\" or \"we\u2019re here for you no matter what\" would mean \n\na lot. It might even help me open up more instead of feeling all shut down just sitting \nthere with my thoughts. That kind of acceptance would be comforting and give me hope \nthat we can have those deeper conversations without it being too heavy or awkward.\nCounselor: I also imagine it is disappointing not to hear these things from them; yet \nyou're aware that it is probably unlikely that they would say such a thing because they \nare unaware of what is really going on with you beneath the surface. \nClient: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s like this cycle of disappointment where I want to connect and \nshare but then hold back because I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d understand. And it sucks to think \nthat they might never know what I'm going through unless I say something\u2014like they're \njust unaware of the struggle beneath the surface.\nI guess sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for a cue or something from them, but it never \ncomes. So I just end up staying quiet and trying to play it cool, even though on the \ninside, I really wish they'd reach out or recognize that things aren\u2019t all fine-and-dandy for \nme. It\u2019s definitely isolating feeling stuck between wanting to connect and being too \nanxious to speak up.\nCounselor: What type of cue would be enough for you to know that it is okay to try to \ndisclose something, even if something modest? \nClient: Um, I think if they just casually mentioned how they also have struggles with \nschool or feelings, that would help a lot. Just a little openness on their part would make \nme feel like it\u2019s safe to share\u2014even if it's something small.\nOr maybe asking how I\u2019ve been doing lately instead of sticking to the usual light topics \ncould be a good cue too. Just showing that they're interested in more than just surface-\nlevel stuff would make me feel more comfortable trying to disclose even something \nmodest about what I\u2019m experiencing. It\u2019s really all about creating that safe space where \nsharing doesn\u2019t feel so scary.\nCounselor: I wonder, have you even seen any of these types of cues in them?  In other \nwords, have you seen one of your friends opening up about themselves which allowed \nyou to be there for them? \nClient: Um, a couple of times, yeah. I remember one of my friends mentioned struggling \nwith schoolwork and feeling really stressed about it. It caught me off guard because \nthey usually seem so on top of everything. In those moments, I felt like I could be there \nfor them and support them.\nBut when it came to sharing my own stuff... I don't know, it\u2019s different for me. Even \nthough they opened up a bit, I still felt this hesitation to reciprocate. It's like I'm scared \nthat if I'm not as strong or positive as them in their moment of struggle, maybe they'll \nsee me differently? \nSo yeah, it's cool to see them open up and feel more connected in those moments\u2014but \nfor some reason when it's my turn, that anxiety just takes over again.\nCounselor: There is a lot of risk in putting yourself out there and being vulnerable/ \n\nClient: Yeah, exactly. It feels super risky to be vulnerable. Like, what if they don\u2019t get it \nor think I\u2019m just being dramatic? Or worse, what if they don\u2019t want to hang out with me \nanymore because of my struggles? That fear makes it really hard for me to open up.\nSo even though I see that my friends can share and still be accepted, I worry that my \nown feelings won't be received the same way. It\u2019s tough wanting to connect but feeling \nthat risk holding me back from actually doing it. Sometimes it just feels safer to stay \nquiet and keep everything bottled up instead.\nCounselor: Safer and yet disappointed because it is lonely. \nClient: Yeah, that\u2019s totally it. It feels like I\u2019m choosing the \u201csafer\u201d route by not opening \nup, but at the same time, it just leads to disappointment and loneliness. It\u2019s frustrating \nknowing that I could potentially feel better if I shared more but then being scared of the \nbacklash\u2014or worse, keeping everything inside and still feeling isolated.\nIt\u2019s like this constant tug-of-war between wanting to connect with my friends and just \nprotecting myself from possible rejection or misunderstanding. And even though I know \nit might be nice to share and feel less alone, that fear often wins out. \nCounselor: It does seem like a very challenging dilemma.  Feeling safe but not really. \nProtected but also harmed by protecting oneself.  \nClient: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s such a tough situation to be in. Like I\u2019m trying to protect myself \nfrom feeling rejected or judged, but in the end, I\u2019m just making myself feel more alone \nand isolated. It feels like a double-edged sword where I think I'm doing the right thing by \nkeeping things inside, but it ends up hurting me just as much\u2014if not more.\nI want that connection and understanding from my friends so badly, but the fear of being \nvulnerable makes it hard to reach out. So instead of finding safety in sharing my \nfeelings, I\u2019m stuck feeling both protected and cut off at the same time. It\u2019s really \nexhausting to navigate those mixed emotions constantly.\nCounselor: You've really opened up to me in the last 10 minutes.  You have such \nexpressive feelings that you have shared; evidence that the words are in there and \nyou're able to share them with another person.  I wonder what is different about our \nconversation versus with your friends? \nClient: Um, I guess it feels different because this is more of a safe space where I don\u2019t \nfeel judgmental vibes or pressure to be someone I'm not. You\u2019ve been really \nunderstanding and respectful about what I\u2019m feeling, which just makes it easier for me \nto talk. It\u2019s like there's no expectation for me to be all fun and positive\u2014just a place \nwhere I can share what's on my mind without worrying too much.\nWith my friends, there\u2019s that underlying fear of how they\u2019ll react or if they\u2019ll feel weird \nabout it. Plus, we often stick with lighter topics because that\u2019s what tends to keep things \nfeeling good among us\u2014so when the heavier stuff comes up, it feels riskier.\nSo yeah, just being able to express myself here without that pressure really helps me \nopen up more than I usually do with them. It's nice in a way!\n\nCounselor: Having the assurance that you're in a safe place when you disclose the \ninner most feelings is important. \nClient: Definitely! That assurance of being in a safe place makes all the difference. It\u2019s \nlike I can actually breathe and let my guard down a bit. When I feel that safety, it lets me \nshare things that are usually buried under anxiety and fear\u2014like talking about what I'm \nreally going through.\nIt\u2019s reassuring to know there won\u2019t be judgment or expectations here, and I think that \nhelps me explore my feelings more openly. With my friends, though... it feels trickier \nbecause there's that pressure to keep everything fun and lighthearted; otherwise, it\u2019s \nlike risking everything if I go deeper. So yeah, having that safety net is key for me when \ntalking about inner feelings!\nCounselor: I wonder if the context matters too?  Maybe disclosing to friends when you \nare out or in school school, too many leering eyes and ears... or the group think typical \nof high schoolers, even good friends... but a conversation in a more intimate setting, not \ntoo intense but natural and more facilitative of being more open and authentic? \nClient: Yeah, that\u2019s a really good point. The context makes a huge difference! When I'm \nwith my friends in school or out in public, it feels like there are too many eyes and ears \naround. It can turn into this group dynamic where everyone\u2019s trying to keep things light \nor funny, and you don\u2019t want to be the one who brings all the heavy stuff to the table.\nIn more intimate settings, though\u2014like just one-on-one conversations or low-pressure \nhangouts\u2014it\u2019s way easier to be open and authentic. There\u2019s less fear of what others \nmight think or say if I share something vulnerable. It feels like there\u2019s room for deeper \nconversations without feeling judged by an audience of classmates.\nSo yeah, having a comfortable setting allows me to let my guard down and really \nconnect with someone instead of feeling caught up in that high school vibe where \neverything needs to appear perfect or fun all the time. \nCounselor: Are there any friends who are less risky and settings that are less risky?  \nMaybe if you could predict it, you could plan for a very low risk but nonetheless \nimportant disclosure to see how you feel and how they respond? \nClient: Um, yeah, I think there are a couple of friends who might be more supportive \nand easier to talk to. Like, there\u2019s one friend who seems really understanding and has \nopened up about their own struggles before; talking to them feels less risky. \nAs for settings, maybe hanging out somewhere quieter\u2014like just grabbing coffee or \nchilling outside when it\u2019s not too busy would work best? It could help get rid of that \npressure from being in a crowded space or having lots of people around.\nIf I could plan it out ahead, I\u2019d want to start with something small\u2014maybe just mention \nfeeling stressed about school or saying that I sometimes feel lost during class. That way \nit\u2019s like dipping my toes in the water without going all in right away. Seeing how they \nrespond could give me more confidence for future discussions, you know? It feels \nmanageable that way!\n\nCounselor: Might this be something you could try this week?  Maybe we can take our \nlast few minutes to create a tangible and yet flexible plan. \nClient: Yeah, I think that's a good idea! Creating a plan sounds helpful. Okay, so maybe \nI could reach out to my friend and see if they want to hang out this week\u2014maybe grab \ncoffee or just chill in a park where it\u2019s quieter.\nI could aim for one of the days after school when we can have some time alone without \nothers around. And then for the actual conversation, I could start by asking them how \nthey've been feeling with everything happening at school. That way, it opens the door \nfor sharing without it feeling too intimidating.\nIf they share something first, then I can gauge how comfortable they are with deeper \ntopics and see if it's okay to mention my own feelings of stress or confusion about class \nwork as well. But if things feel tense or heavy at any point, I can just steer the \nconversation back to lighter stuff.\nSo yeah! It\u2019s kind of flexible; if I'm not feeling\nCounselor: You sound motivated and enthused.\nClient: Thanks! I guess thinking about it this way makes me feel a bit more hopeful. \nHaving a plan feels like I have some control over the situation, and that kind of takes off \nsome pressure. \nJust knowing that I might be able to share something\u2014even if it's small\u2014feels exciting \nand scary at the same time! But yeah, I'm definitely feeling more motivated to give it a \nshot. It\u2019s nice to have something positive to work towards instead of just staying stuck in \nmy head all the time. \nCounselor: Maybe more addition to this plan, how about you and I plan on meeting \nagain next week where we can talk about how it went? \nClient: Yeah, that sounds great! Having a check-in next week would be super helpful. I \ncan think about how it went and share what worked or didn\u2019t work during the \nconversation. Just being able to talk it through with you afterward will help me process \neverything.\nI\u2019ll make sure to write down any feelings or reactions I have after the hangout so it's \neasier to remember everything when we meet again. It feels good to have that follow-up \nplanned, like I\u2019ve got support no matter what happens this week. Thanks for being so \nunderstanding!\nCounselor: I am very proud of you for this plan.  Regardless of how it goes, you have \naccomplished a lot by disclosing authentically to me and creating a plan that can \npotentially affect relationships outside of our counseling talks. \nClient: Thank you! That really means a lot to me. Just hearing that you're proud makes \nme feel more encouraged about everything. I think having this plan and being able to \ntalk about it here with you has already started to help me feel more confident.\n\nI know it won\u2019t be easy, but it feels like a step in the right direction\u2014like I\u2019m actually \ndoing something that could make a difference in my friendships. So, yeah, I appreciate \nyour support so much! I'm looking forward to our next session and sharing how it goes.\nCounselor: See you next week.  \nClient: See you next week! Thanks again for everything. I\u2019ll be thinking about our \nconversation and my plan. Take care!"}
